1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hi. Is this Kyle?
3. [Prospect]  Yeah.
4. [Sales Rep]  Kyle, hi. This is Daniel with Nook's. I'm actually using Nook's to call you. It's an AI that made 300 calls for me over the past 2 hours. You're my 16th conversation. In that same period of time, if we were to set a meeting, you'd be my 6th. That's what we do for biz dev and sales dev teams. Would you be interested in taking a closer look at this?
5. [Prospect]  So is it really just the multidialer, or is there you said there's an AI component too as well?
6. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. So it's a multi dialer. There's a couple AI components. One AI component is that, it dials multiple people for me, and so the AI is trained to differentiate a live pickup, aka you from, like, somebody's voice mail. But we also do if you've ever, like, tried to use Gong for the SDR team, we actually do what Gong does, But specifically for cold calling and for SDRs, that's how we're using AI. And in addition to that, A lot of convos with a multidiiler can seem, you know, potentially overwhelming, and it would take a lot of preparation. But, we have this very unique personalization dashboard that as soon as it connected, I see your LinkedIn pro I like, I see all the main stuff of your LinkedIn profile In front of me, and I see your work history and all of that. And that and and, yeah, and any account history that we have with other people on your team, but you're actually the 1st person I reached out to and that at this account in this case. But, yeah, short answer is, that's what our AI does. Basically, call analysis Objection intelligence and objection analysis, but also to distinguish a live pickup from a voice mail. And that's how I was able to get, 16 conversations over the past 2 hours like this one.
7. [Prospect]  Gotcha. You know, I'd be kind of intrigued, but probably wouldn't be in a position to even Look at something like this and tell Q1 at the earliest. We're kind of consolidating some processes over here. We use a system called Outreach. Io that does some of what we're doing right now. We're gonna go and revert to, the Salesforce, application, I think it's called high velocity or something like that, to kinda take the cost centers down some. So I think at this point, we're really just trying to cut costs, not exactly Take on more tools. But depending on how the the year ends, that might be something that we could kinda circle back with next year.
8. [Sales Rep]  I see.
9. [Prospect]  So I'd say, really, at this point in time, really nothing to to talk about. But if you wanna send me an email Just with some basic information, I can keep that on my side for whenever we're actually starting to look into technology again.
10. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Cool. Yeah. I'll send something your way. I'm sure you guys would like it. We by the time that you'd be ready to talk more about Stuff. We we will have our Salesforce integration complete, which is great. So,
11. [Prospect]  Oh, good. Good.
12. [Sales Rep]  that that kharding@ecisolutions.com. Is that right?
13. [Prospect]  That's right. And that's good to know. I mean, we wouldn't really be in a position to wanna talk until that's actually fully, implemented and you've already beta tested And everything like that is we're kind of a larger organization. So, yeah, especially once you get that info integration going, feel free to give me a shout back, and I'd be happy to have another conversation then.
14. [Sales Rep]  Course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. We're beta testing right now. It'll be more than ready to go by then. That's what I mean.
15. [Prospect]  Okay. Perfect, man. Well, that sounds good.
16. [Sales Rep]  Cool. Awesome. Talk soon.
17. [Prospect]  Alright. Sounds good.
