1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Brian.
3. [Prospect]  Yes.
4. [Sales Rep]  Hi, Brian. It's, it's Cameron Baker over at Nook's. Totally frank, this is a a cold call. Do you have 30 seconds to hear me out, see if it makes sense to chat?
5. [Prospect]  Sure.
6. [Sales Rep]  Thanks. I appreciate it. Hey. I just curious to LHH for your SDR team. How how important is cold calling to their own your own pipeline, Jen?
7. [Prospect]  Very important.
8. [Sales Rep]  Very important. Okay. Do your reps, do they have like a system that they they use to go about that, like an outreach or SalesLoft
9. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah. We use Outreach.
10. [Sales Rep]  or oh, cool. Gotcha. Few challenges that we're hearing from from teams where Similarly, it's very important, Brian, is is number 1, connect rates are going down. So it's getting harder and harder to connect with prospects, More activity it's taken to get the job done.
11. [Prospect]  Yep.
12. [Sales Rep]  In response, we see a lot of the time where, you know, you have your all stars on the team who are actually putting in the dials to drive meaningful pipe, but there's quite a a gap in KPIs and activity. And lastly, it can be difficult to make messaging pivots and, It actually changed TalkTrax without, listening to call after call. Is any of that any of those challenges relevant for you at the moment or am I totally off track with that?
13. [Prospect]  Can you say them again? Like, one who's taken, like, connect rates are down. And
14. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Great.
15. [Prospect]  what else?
16. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Just simply, you know, the case where a lot of reps aren't actually making enough dials anymore, gaps and activity between the best and others and then just enablement challenges when it comes to messaging and and getting the team together.
17. [Prospect]  Yeah. Actually, this is my 1st day back from paternity leave. So, Before I left, yeah. Numbers were good. Like, the rest are making the dials. But, yeah, the connect rates are super low. They're just not getting through to people. People aren't picking up the phone. From the enablement side, We're pretty good. We've got a good enablement manager, good team. So, I mean, really, the what struggle for us is We're making a ton of dials and just not having quality conversations, not getting through to people.
18. [Sales Rep]  Hi. Just curious, aside, are your teams calling mobiles or?
19. [Prospect]  Both. Yeah. Yep. Yep. They're we we're calling cell phones when when we have access to them.
20. [Sales Rep]  Right. Right. And your team is is remote as well. Right? Kind of spread out.
21. [Prospect]  Yep.
22. [Sales Rep]  Right. So what we do is, You know, essentially, how we're helping at Nook is just giving reps more at bats, allowing them to have more conversations. We do have some areas in which we directly impact that connect 3. But what we do away with is kind of that 1 by 1 dialing and logging and manual work for your reps where, You know, 95% of those people that they're working on are picking up the phone. So our software only connects us. I used it for this call to to folks like yourself who pick up the phone. You know, in practice, I've been dialing for the last half an hour, and you're my 7 through 8 live conversation that I've had as opposed to that used to take me all day day to do when I'm working out about reach or SalesLoft.
23. [Prospect]  Yep.
24. [Sales Rep]  Some some pretty cool, for your remote team as well. Something that comes to mind is we do have a virtual Salesforce aspect as well. So your reps can actually hear, You know, calls that are going on bidirectionally live, some really cool feedback or or live feedback loops that can happen there. But does that sound like something that might be might be worth showing you next week? Or,
25. [Prospect]  Yeah. What's what's the name of your company again?
26. [Sales Rep]  it's called Nook's. So it's like books with an n.
27. [Prospect]  And then Okay. Okay. Sounds like it's sort of like connect and sell.
28. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. We're similar to Connect and Sell. Connect and Sell and Orum.
29. [Prospect]  Yep.
30. [Sales Rep]  Only difference between Connect and Sell and us is I would say we're We're relying more on the artificial intelligence instead of, like, outsourced call center folks.
31. [Prospect]  Actual people calling. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because I know they have they have people actually making these dials when they connect to the The the rep if somebody answers. Yeah. I you know? So to To give you some context, we're looking at Orem as an organization.
32. [Sales Rep]  Okay.
33. [Prospect]  We're actually evaluating a handful of tools right now to put into the budget for next year. I would be happy to take a look. Again, my 1st day back after I was away for 6 weeks. So I don't know where the team like, where my VP and the rest of the team stands and in terms of the tools we're piloting right now. But, yeah, I'd be happy to take a look and If it makes sense, then I can roll it out to my VP and our our wider organization to see if it's something we'd be interested in in in piloting or taking a deeper look at.
34. [Sales Rep]  Cool. Yeah. Yeah. We typically do a 2 week to month free trial for for normally 10 reps or, however many Wanna do so we can
35. [Prospect]  Okay.
36. [Sales Rep]  take a look at that. Listen to invite your way here. I've got my calendar open for, for, at the moment. And we can whether end of week this or beginning of week next, just let me know what you got.
37. [Prospect]  Yeah. Hold on here. Let me let me pull up my, let me pull up my calendar here. Or Next week at this point is Gonna be better because I'm just I'm still playing catch up and stuff.

62. [Sales Rep]  Right.
63. [Prospect]  Do you think it'd be possible to do sort of like a meeting swap and set up a meeting with maybe a VP of HR or HR director just to to introduce our services to you guys. But I don't see you guys in our

70. [Sales Rep]  I I don't know what that means What that means to you or or how you would, how you would approach that?
71. [Prospect]  Well, yeah, it doesn't necessarily have to be, With like a VP of HR. Right? You know, really and if it doesn't make sense, tell me tell me it doesn't. You know, if you guys are a growing company, some of it you probably well, you know, it could be VP of HR, if it's leadership development, if you guys are looking at growing the skills of, like, your sales leaders, it could be Could be, like, VP of sales, director of sales.

73. [Prospect]  We have we have team effectiveness solutions, where we come in and we do an assessment of your of your team and say, hey. These these are the gaps, and this is what you can do to to close these gaps and increase the skills around the team working together. It Could be a CFO. Right? If you if you guys are looking at I don't know. If there's looking at layoffs and the now placement program, we meet with a lot of,
74. [Sales Rep]  Right.
75. [Prospect]  CFOs and just talk to you the the cost of that. So, maybe somebody along along those lines.

77. [Prospect]  Gotcha. Gotcha.

79. [Prospect]  Okay. Okay.
80. [Sales Rep]  So, yeah, let me, let me chat with him and and that might be a possibility and then Maybe we can bring him into the meeting and see if that makes sense.
