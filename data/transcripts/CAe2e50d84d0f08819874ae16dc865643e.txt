1. [Prospect]  Hello.
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Brandon.
3. [Prospect]  Yep.
4. [Sales Rep]  Hey. Sorry about that. I thought I went to voice mail item. This is Cameron over at Nook's. We had connected 2 weeks back or so, and you told me to try again next week. You have 30 seconds to hear me out.
5. [Prospect]  Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.
6. [Sales Rep]  Appreciate that, man. I I was just curious to start if your SCR team at WiseHive is is cold calling. Is that also an important part of pipeline gen over there?
7. [Prospect]  It is, but why don't you start by telling me what NUCs is? I'm not familiar.
8. [Sales Rep]  About Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you how I used it to, to reach you. So, in the last hour or so, as opposed to me living in Outreach and, making call by call, logging no call tasks about for the 95% of folks that don't answer. Nooks only connects me to live conversation. So I've been calling for about half an hour. Your my 7th or 8th conversation. All the manual work for the rest of the folks that are that are in any sales sequence I have is taken care of in the back end. About So, yeah, simply, really just speeding up the amount of at bats and conversations that that reps can have typically, typically, noticeably, you know, making a change in pipeline too.
9. [Prospect]  Quick question for you.
10. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
11. [Prospect]  Does this automatically record all your calls?
12. [Sales Rep]  About it. Not only automatically records them. It it does do that. You can you can toggle that on and off. It it also stores,
13. [Prospect]  Is it recording this 1?
14. [Sales Rep]  this one should be being recorded. Yeah. If I as long as the software's working.
15. [Prospect]  Okay. I'm curious because I have a nine one six number, which I'm I don't know if the rules in California I'm pretty sure the rules in California are You're supposed to say, hey. This is on a recorded line. Curious if you've run into needing to say that out loud.
16. [Sales Rep]  So we've actually been running into that more frequently or, I guess, that that concern with companies. I know that's why, why we introduced, like, the this toggle feature to, turn on call turn on and off the call recording, and I think that would have to, yeah, have to be done on kind of a per rep about basis. I'm unable to do so. But,
17. [Prospect]  Okay.
18. [Sales Rep]  yeah. I I
19. [Prospect]  My other question for you was, Okay. So there's that. Okay. So high level, I've looked into this before. There's
20. [Sales Rep]  about yeah.
21. [Prospect]  you guys might be You guys might be you're not the only one who does this. There's probably a big software that I've looked into in the past who does this, but nonetheless, it doesn't really matter. I have only about 3 reps of which Only really 2 of them would be leveraging a software like this. Now
22. [Sales Rep]  About
23. [Prospect]  it's super interesting, and it makes complete sense. If it didn't make sense,
24. [Sales Rep]  about
25. [Prospect]  Somebody tells you this doesn't make sense and they're an idiot. So this definitely makes sense. The question is cost, right? Like that's we invested in sales
26. [Sales Rep]  about
27. [Prospect]  Navigator. We invested in a video email service. So and I would imagine something like this would Be a pretty decent price tag. So for a 3 person team, just roughly speaking, no bells or whistles needed. What does it usually run roughly? And I know you're probably don't wanna give away price, but I'm just I'm not really in the spot where,
28. [Sales Rep]  about
29. [Prospect]  You know, I I kinda just need a rough idea so that I can even just poke my boss and see if she's interested because when you're in a situation where you've had a lot of Person go.
30. [Sales Rep]  about Yeah.
31. [Prospect]  In the past, it's like just contextually speaking. You don't want to be the guy who said, hey, we just laid off a person. Let me buy a software for $20 a year. What do you think? It's like it's pretty
32. [Sales Rep]  Right.
33. [Prospect]  it's not very, respectful to what's going on in the org. So Can you have an idea for me?
34. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. 3 person team that you'd probably be looking at around 9 to 10 k for the entire year. If you wanna go, you know, power dialer instead of parallel, there's there's leeway there. And, about, what I can share with you too, though, is,
35. [Prospect]  What's the difference?
36. [Sales Rep]  power is just 1 number at a time. It's still letting the AI, you know, log the call tasks in the background while the parallel is gonna call, you know, 5 pros or up to 5 prospects at the same time, about which just, you know, depending on your connect rate, either or can make sense. But, I can tell you too that that like most, you know, we can typically, we're gonna, you know, allow a 2 week to a month free trial. Really show if that ROI is there. I think the price becomes an easier conversation if, say, your your reps hop about and and start booking a lot more meetings.
37. [Prospect]  Sure. Okay. That's good good context. Thank you for that.
38. [Sales Rep]  About yeah. You bet.
39. [Prospect]  Is the how does the pricing structure work?
40. [Sales Rep]  So it's gonna be, annual. It's per month or per rep per month pricing, but billed annually.
41. [Prospect]  Okay. What is the per rep per month?
42. [Sales Rep]  300.
43. [Prospect]  300 per rep
44. [Sales Rep]  About
45. [Prospect]  Current month. And is that for power dialer or parallel?
46. [Sales Rep]  that that's for a full parallel, about full parallel, everything included. The call recording library, virtual sales floor dialer.
47. [Prospect]  Okay. Okay. Well, why don't you send me info over for A month trial. If we if we give it a shot and imagine $3.300
48. [Sales Rep]  About
49. [Prospect]  per rep per month, could either find itself paying off
50. [Sales Rep]  about
51. [Prospect]  or not with the free trial.
52. [Sales Rep]  about Yeah. Yeah.
53. [Prospect]  I will probably wait To do any sort of trial until I can hire 1 more person. I have an open head count right now, so, obviously, I wouldn't wanna waste the trial while I only have One less person. So,
54. [Sales Rep]  About
55. [Prospect]  if you wanna send over some info, I'll probably circle back to you once I have that person in c and ramped. It'll probably be about a month, maybe a month and a half to the point where it makes sense to I don't wanna waste the trial On a time frame where we're just not ready for it, but, yeah, I mean, yeah, seeing is believing, so the trial definitely helps. You guys offering
56. [Sales Rep]  yeah. Yeah. You bet. Is it alright, Brandon? Does it make sense to put, like because typically we do a about, half hour call before the,
57. [Prospect]  that.
58. [Sales Rep]  before the trial. Does it make sense to put a placeholder
59. [Prospect]  I understand.
60. [Sales Rep]  in this month?
61. [Prospect]  Yeah. I understand. Why don't we set That placeholder for, let's just do, like, 3rd week of October, And I'll I'll I'll make time for it. I just wanna make sure I'm have a person in seat And I'm already making progress before I go do the demo.
62. [Sales Rep]  About yeah. You bet. I'll, I'll send the place over just for or placeholder for some time in that 3rd week of October, of course.
63. [Prospect]  It's fine. I'll just I'll just pull it up. Let's do let's do Friday morning on 20th.
64. [Sales Rep]  About Friday.
65. [Prospect]  Could you do, like, a 9 AM PST?
66. [Sales Rep]  9 AM PST. Certainly. Yeah. Let's do 9 AM PST. So about 12 PM EST. About alright. I just sent that over to you.
67. [Prospect]  Is this integrate with HubSpot, or is it on Standalone.
68. [Sales Rep]  Placement. About yeah. So it sounds like the the email sequences call tasks are coming out of sub HubSpot for your team.
69. [Prospect]  How do They are. They are right now. Yeah.
70. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. We integrate directly with HubSpot. So that'll work. HubSpot, SalesLoft, Outreach. Yeah. Yeah. It'll work.
71. [Prospect]  So the we currently have we call out of HubSpot with our we've kinda just put our Zoom number In there, it's like a call forward type deal.
72. [Sales Rep]  About
73. [Prospect]  I imagine the call would still happen the same way. It would just The that that that's I'm jumping ahead of myself. That's that's easy to ask in October, So we can just hit it then.
74. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Yeah. That that might better be a better question for our account executive. But, yeah, we'll, we'll look forward to I'll send you, like, a 1 pager or something,
75. [Prospect]  Cool.
76. [Sales Rep]  that. I'll stay in touch when we get closer too just to make sure that still good timing and everything. But, yeah, best of luck in filling with ramping the new rep.
77. [Prospect]  K. Alright. Thank you.
78. [Sales Rep]  It. Alright. Thanks, Brandon. You take care.
79. [Prospect]  Alright. You too. Bye.
