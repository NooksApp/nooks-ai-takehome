3. [Prospect]  From where?
4. [Sales Rep]  From, Nook. Any chance you've ever heard of us?
5. [Prospect]  Yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes. This is, like, the worst time I'm in. It's Friday, and I'm trying to push the team to call. I don't even have a second.
6. [Sales Rep]  Oh my god. No worries, man.
7. [Prospect]  So call me back next
8. [Sales Rep]  Will do. Cheers, Kyle.
