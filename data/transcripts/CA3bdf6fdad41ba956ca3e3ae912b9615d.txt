1. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Terme. Yes, Terme. It's, it's Cameron Baker over at Nook's. Totally frank. This is a a cold call. Do you have a a brief 30 seconds? Awesome. Appreciate that. Hey. I'd I'm just curious first, are your reps are they placing outbound cold calls as well? Okay. Yeah. I spoke to Maria the other day, the SDR lead for North America. She let me know this might be more relevant for you. I know they weren't. Her team, she said, is more social selling focus, but, I'll jump right into it. I've reached you with our platform. It's called Nook's. At at its core, it's an AI powered parallel dialer. So instead of that typical workflow where I'm in my sales engaging class platform, clicking dial, waiting for the ringtone, maybe getting a pickup, but only 5 to 10% of people answering. My system is only connecting me to folks like yourself who pick up the phone. At the same time, it's handling all those manual call tasks, sending reporting and recordings back to you as a manager so you can enable your team. Have you explored anything like that in the past? Okay. I can do that for me. Thanks. Yeah.
