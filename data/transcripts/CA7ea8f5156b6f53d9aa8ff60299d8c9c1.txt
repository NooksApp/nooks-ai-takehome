1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Rose, this is Josh with Nook's. Happy Friday. It's it's Josh calling with Nook's. Happy Friday.
3. [Prospect]  Happy Friday. How can I help you with?
4. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. No. I Rose, I'm I'm straight up. I'm calling you out of the blue here. Do you have 30 seconds? I'll if I miss the mark, I'll hang up on myself. Okay. I appreciate you. I know cold calls are the worst. So I was just curious though, Rose. I know you're over at Notable, leading the SDR team over there, and I'm just I'm curious if they're making annoying cold calls like this one, if that's part of your strategy over there.
5. [Prospect]  Yeah. We're actually, we're Kinda moving away from that. We're obviously in the mid stages, but, we do have kind of a go ahead strategy, as far as moving kind of away from cold calling as our main Source.
6. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Yeah. That's totally fair. I just because it hasn't been very effective for you or you have more inbound coming in now or
7. [Prospect]  It's I wouldn't say it hasn't been effective for us. It's Obviously, a more time consuming, strategy than, you know, sending out The right emails to the right people and and seeing what comes in. So
8. [Sales Rep]  Totally. Yeah. No. That's I mean, Rhodes, straight up. I'll I'll I'll be quick here because I know it's Friday and you're I'm I don't wanna stand between you and your weekend plans, but, I'm calling from Nook. So we're an AI parallel dialer. I don't know if you've if you've heard of those before, but basically, like, what you just said is exactly why I was reaching out. Like, I'm talking to SDR managers every day and cold calls take forever. And so you're I mean, I I remember so many times sitting there and spending an hour to make 40 dials and just sitting, Like, listening to the ringtone, you know, which can make it really hard to improve as well and, like, for you to give coaching if they're just not if your reps just aren't getting a lot of at bats. And so With NUCs we're solving that problem. You're able to, we play nice with SalesLoft, Outreach, a lot of other tools you're probably using So that your reps can call multiple people at a time and just get those connects a lot faster and spend less time listening to the ringtone.
9. [Prospect]  Yeah. We so we've actually tried, a pilot with Orem, which sounds Pretty similar to Nook.
10. [Sales Rep]  Okay.
11. [Prospect]  Unfortunately, it just wasn't a very good fit for us. We are in a pretty finite market when it comes to health care. There's only so many, you know, per personas and titles that fit with our decision maker profile. And so the long term strategy here cannot be, you know, blasting their their phones until they answer. And so we are moving away from that as, you know, something that we we've already basically, we've already tried it, something that didn't really make a, you know, big push into our knee to our needle for us, and so I don't think that it would be a good fit for Notable to do anything with
12. [Sales Rep]  Mhmm. K. No. That's totally fine. I appreciate all the context. I One thing that I'll say just for food for thought down the road, like I know a lot of people use the parallel dialer as a spray and pray, almost the same thing as like Blasting out 500 emails at a time. It doesn't it doesn't really work. It's not effective, especially for the SDRs. It's feels Kinda lousy calling the same person every day and and you're not prepared for the call. And so you're able to still call, like, if you if you wanted to your reps Just calling 40, 50 people a day or whatever. Like, we don't recommend blasting the same people every day or multiple times a day. It's Keeping in the sequence or cadence that your reps are already dialing in, but then they make those dials like through outreach, and so you can do, or through Nook, sorry, so that they're just Getting through them a little bit quicker. And then the virtual sales floor is pretty cool too. I know that's something a little bit different with Orem where if your reps is are you is your team remote, Rose? Are they all?
13. [Prospect]  Yeah. Well, it's it's half an
14. [Sales Rep]  Yep. Okay. I I know for myself, like, being a remote SDR, The sales floor is pretty cool because now I get to make calls with other SDRs. Literally, like, if I get a pickup, I'm taken into a different room. Anybody on the team can listen to my call, give me coaching through the chat, and then we all, like, can talk about it afterwards. Listen to Spotify. Like, it actually makes a a fun, like, atmosphere for the team instead of dials being this, like, Seeing everybody dredges, you
15. [Prospect]  Right.
16. [Sales Rep]  know?
17. [Prospect]  Well, I tell you what, now is not a good time. We're in the midst of a lot of transitions and, also expecting to have, a lot of new heads on the team, by the end of the year. So you can give me a callback, You know, closer to end of year, and then, you know, we can talk about whether or not we see this as as part of the strategy moving forward.
18. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. That's totally fair. I would you hate me if I just Sent like a 15 minute sync for end of the year, and then if it's if it's totally irrelevant, you can just let me know. Hey, Josh. Let's push this. Or if it is because if you are onboarding new folks, like the virtual sales floor is pretty cool for that too. So it might be
19. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah. Go you can go ahead and send me send me a quick invite. I'll go ahead and accept it.
20. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Amazing. Rose, and it's rosenotablehealth.com.
21. [Prospect]  Yep. That's correct.
22. [Sales Rep]  Okay. I will send it for December. Rose, Cold calls are the worst. It's Friday. Bless your heart for being nice. I appreciate that.
23. [Prospect]  Alright. You have a good weekend.
24. [Sales Rep]  Hey. You as well. Thank you so much. I'll send the invite right now. Okay. Bye bye.
