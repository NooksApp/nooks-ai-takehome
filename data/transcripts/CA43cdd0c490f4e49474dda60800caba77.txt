1. [Prospect]  Hi, Sam. Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Alan, this is hey. This is Josh with Nook's. How's your Tuesday treating you?
3. [Prospect]  Yeah. Okay. What can
4. [Sales Rep]  Good. Hey. I'm good. Thanks. Allen, I I straight up I know I'm probably catching you mid coffee, so if you have 30 seconds, if I miss Mark Allen, I'll just throw my phone at the wall.
5. [Prospect]  I do for you? Yeah. I know who you guys
6. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Good deal. What have you heard about us?
7. [Prospect]  Perfect. I got a response from an inquiry that I made with with you guys back in June, and it was one of the worst DDR, SDR responses I've received this year.
8. [Sales Rep]  Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. I sent you an email. That didn't make your words list, did it?
9. [Prospect]  Skyler Werneth. You know who Skyler is?
10. [Sales Rep]  Okay. I do. Yeah.
11. [Prospect]  Yeah, let's see. And no signature, no punctuation just pretty disappointing. So That killed things for me at the time.
12. [Sales Rep]  Oh, okay. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. I, I sent you I sent you an email last week. Hopefully
13. [Prospect]  Yeah. Me too.
14. [Sales Rep]  hopefully it wasn't I don't I I don't know. I'd we use outreach, so it says you opened it one time on Friday. I don't know if that makes your top
15. [Prospect]  Oh, there you go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You guys compete with Orem. Right?
16. [Sales Rep]  Bad list. Yeah.
17. [Prospect]  Yep. Yeah. So we just, we just ended our contract with Orem. I decided not to renew.
18. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. We do.
19. [Prospect]  So I've I've,
20. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Okay.
21. [Prospect]  I we so just to give you some perspective, I lead our US BDR team. About a 120 people across the US.
22. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
23. [Prospect]  As you
24. [Sales Rep]  Okay.
25. [Prospect]  we're also Outreach users, so we could commiserate on that. I used Connectleader Concert, now known as Concert, for for a while.
26. [Sales Rep]  Okay.
27. [Prospect]  Over the last, I think it was 15 months. We used Aurum.
28. [Sales Rep]  Okay.
29. [Prospect]  Pretty it was okay. I mean, I I think For the actually, the reason we chose or, is isn't it nice to cold call somebody and actually have a conversation? Here you go.
30. [Sales Rep]  Oh my goodness. Yeah. I mean, I'm using Nook's right now. So, yes, I can relate.
31. [Prospect]  Yeah. So, So a few things. 1, I wasn't on board with their their how expensive Orum is. So that was One of the reasons why I pulled the plug. One of the reasons, actually, we chose Orum, though, was the, elegance, with integrating with Outreach because we are such, significant Outreach users. Only the sales engagement element of Outreach. We don't use any other, of the the suite or platform functionality. So we don't use any of the the pipeline stuff or what have you within my organization or, frankly, anywhere in our business. The rest of our business uses Clari to to run pipeline and all that jazz.
32. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Okay.
33. [Prospect]  But yeah. So, you know, a few things that were disappointing. You know, we thought the whole AI AI A portion of their tool was actually kind of created a pain in the ass for my reps. And the reason for that is because, you know, they would go through their dials and and the AI, like, what's the thing I'm looking at, like, the corporate number navigation. You know, it's kinda hit or miss.
34. [Sales Rep]  Mhmm.
35. [Prospect]  And then there'd be a bunch of calls that didn't get made, and then The DVR section had to go do another process within Orem to make those dials. And that was
36. [Sales Rep]  Mhmm.
37. [Prospect]  just messy. So the reality is We pulled the plug. Considering A few things, potentially in the new year. So I'm not gonna make any investments here through the close of the year. One, considering potentially going back to concert. But we don't we don't really see a lot of value because, You know, outside of we wanna pair like, I'm interested generally in a parallel dialer,
38. [Sales Rep]  Right.
39. [Prospect]  And I think the team appreciates that and enjoys it. We don't what I don't want to do is, invest in just a dialer. We'll just use Outreach, and, you know, 1 by 1 by 1 by 1, we'll make the phone calls. So,
40. [Sales Rep]  Right.
41. [Prospect]  that's where we're at. You know, like I said, I reached out in June. Basically, my my concern at the time is, and I bought a lot of technology here. I've been here for almost 7 years. So,
42. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I saw that.
43. [Prospect]  it's not easy for us to get deals done in the business,
44. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
45. [Prospect]  just because we're a publicly traded cybersecurity company. You know? So, I don't know if anyone's more difficult other than a bank to be able to do business with. So I had reached out with with regards to the SOC certifications on your side.
46. [Sales Rep]  Totally. Yeah. That would be important.
47. [Prospect]  And I and I think that that was a box that was checked on your side, which is which is an important box for us amongst many others.
48. [Sales Rep]  You?
49. [Prospect]  So that's the scoop. You know, if you wanna give me some insight into what you all have going on, you know, why y'all think you're Better than than Orem or concert or where you feel your differentiators lie, I'm all yours. And you actually caught me at a good time. I don't I don't have any meetings until my outreach,
50. [Sales Rep]  Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah.
51. [Prospect]  customer success call at at 11:30, so hit me.
52. [Sales Rep]  Amazing. Amazing. I Alan, honestly, first off, I just wanna say that.
53. [Prospect]  What a call.
54. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. I'm here for it. I, yeah. No. I I I appreciate all the context. I I also appreciate you being nice on this cold call because I did my research before I reached out. I watched a couple of your interviews. You seemed like you really cared about your SDRs and you Seems very kind, and I've had people like that that I actually got on a phone and then they were a complete a hole. And you seem genuine and kind, so I have to just Point that out. Your s you guys are lucky to have you. So but
55. [Prospect]  Yeah. Well, I got my days too, so don't go too far.
56. [Sales Rep]  I yeah. I mean, I could have called after you stubbed your toe or spilled your coffee on your shirt, and we might have been having a different combo, but I feel you. I'm so, Alan, it's Super interesting timing on our part too because, I actually just came from a meeting. I'm new here. I've been here for 4 weeks at Nook's.
57. [Prospect]  Oh, cool.
58. [Sales Rep]  I used Nook's at a previous company. We trialed Orem and Nook's and so I'm familiar. Like really I've used both tools. And so This morning though I just came up with a meeting with a director of sales development from one of our customers and they'd used Orem for 2 years and they just Bought Nook's in June. And so I can I can share also, like, this is obviously super early, but happy down the line to set up a conversation between the 2 of you? But
59. [Prospect]  Uh-huh.
60. [Sales Rep]  He was saying that so a couple of reasons why he turned, because I asked him straight up why'd you turn from Orem to Nook's?
61. [Prospect]  Yeah.
62. [Sales Rep]  A big reason was that it was very clunky, and so his reps, yes, it was faster to make dials, but exactly what you were saying, where a lot of times things didn't transfer over, it was clunky to have Go back and redial people. He also had AEs that he wanted using it, and it was really hard to get their buy in because adoption was low because it was not a very intuitive tool. And so he said with NUCs it literally took
63. [Prospect]  Yeah.
64. [Sales Rep]  5 minutes, right, to kind of train his AEs and his SDR team on how to use tool and they were dialing right away. The integration with Outreach. It's a couple clicks and then it's set up. I have a dog in the background.
65. [Prospect]  Yeah. No worries. I'm I I got 2 dogs too. I'm sure they're Gonna start parking any minute.
66. [Sales Rep]  I apologize if you can hear him whining. He need he needs to go pee, so that's that's what he's doing right now. But, So it's just it's a lot smoother. It's a lot it's a lot more intuitive to use, and so your reps aren't going to be having those same those same snags, those same clunks. Also, he was frustrated because He was spending $100,000 with Orem, and he said it would take about 2 weeks to get a response from customer service if he had a problem.
67. [Prospect]  Yeah. So I never had that. So our customer success manager, she was exceptional.
68. [Sales Rep]  With Nook's, that response time
69. [Prospect]  So
70. [Sales Rep]  she was great. Okay. That's good to hear.
71. [Prospect]  if anything, I I would love for her to move to any other provider that we use. She's fantastic.
72. [Sales Rep]  Well, maybe maybe later you can you can message me your name.
73. [Prospect]  But then we also spent a lot of money. So, Yeah.
74. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. And so
75. [Prospect]  But, anyways, go ahead.
76. [Sales Rep]  it I was just gonna say so it's just it ends up being a lot smoother. It's a much smoother, I mean, any SDR is gonna appreciate a parallel dialer, but we don't want all those frustrations of things just falling through the cracks. And so I honestly like, I I I was trialing both tools. I ended up begging the NUCs AE to turn our NUCs Trial back on because after 2 days in Orem, I still was not quite sure how to use the platform. And it was just,
77. [Prospect]  Mhmm.
78. [Sales Rep]  like I said, NUCs takes about 5 minutes to feel comfortable in it. So that's that obviously is super high level. Alan, what I would love to do is, funny timing too, we actually just had one of Orem's top AEs come to NUCs. Last Monday was his 1st day.
79. [Prospect]  Who's that?
80. [Sales Rep]  So his name is Sharra.
81. [Prospect]  Okay.
82. [Sales Rep]  I'm not gonna try and say his last name,
83. [Prospect]  Cool.
84. [Sales Rep]  but his name is Sharra.
85. [Prospect]  Well, you should because you're gonna get a prospect with a a hard last name, let's say, like, Tarkowski. So you gotta
86. [Sales Rep]  I know. I know. Normally normally, I'll Google it beforehand.
87. [Prospect]  phonetically sum it out, man. You'll be fine.
88. [Sales Rep]  That's fine. I get that. Yeah. No. That's so funny. Sharad Davudi. I'll ask him after this if it's the right way to say it. So he was there for,
89. [Prospect]  Cool. Alright then.
90. [Sales Rep]  what, a year 5 months, I think. So do you have any I just I just blasted you with a bunch of stuff, Alan. Do have any questions about anything that I said? Anything you wanna poke
91. [Prospect]  How do you guys structure your pricing model? I mean, you may need to boot me over to your sales rep to have that conversation or not, but, I'm just curious. Just per license per year or per user per year type thing?
92. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I don't wanna I don't wanna yeah. Yeah. So our pricing's super transparent, and, obviously, you being, like, budget's a big deal. So and you have a huge team. Guy I was talking to this morning, he was paying $100,000 with Orem. He's now paying $50,000 with Nook's. Our pricing model
93. [Prospect]  How many users for the app?
94. [Sales Rep]  ends up working out not quite as big of a team as yours, I don't think, but he basically to give you an idea, with $300
95. [Prospect]  Yeah.
96. [Sales Rep]  per month, Per rep, it's annual pricing, so that works out to about 36100 per rep. Obviously, like, I that's That's like high level. I'd let you to, like, talk to Shara more about that because there's obviously things that we'd be able to work in with you. But so we come in usually about half the cost of Orem, which is
97. [Prospect]  Yeah.
98. [Sales Rep]  Is nice, but the thing too, do you have a virtual sales team, it sounds or sorry, a remote sales team, it sounds like? Like, obviously, you're all over the US.
99. [Prospect]  No. We're all we're all in our offices. So I've got Reps at headquarters where I work in Sunnyvale, California. And then I've got staff in our we've got offices all around the country. So I've got staff in Plano, Texas,
100. [Sales Rep]  Okay.
101. [Prospect]  Chicago, Boston, New York City, and Sunrise, Florida.
102. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Cool.
103. [Prospect]  But we're we're we're an in office team for the most
104. [Sales Rep]  Nice. Oh, I love that. Nice.
105. [Prospect]  Perfect.
106. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I was just so, I mean, we can show you on a demo what the virtual sales floor would look like. If you even if you're ever doing like dial blitzes in office, it can be kind of fun.
107. [Prospect]  Yeah.
108. [Sales Rep]  But, Alan, I know that this is something that you're you're looking at for next year as far as, like, the potential purchase, but I know a lot Folks are looking at budget come q four. Usually, the ones on the shortlist, you know, have a better chance to get in budget for it. Would you be totally opposed if I like, it would be It would be fun to show you, especially with an ex Aurum AE on the call to show you exactly what it looks like and
109. [Prospect]  Yeah. Let's do it. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
110. [Sales Rep]  to show you, like k.

This is a longer cold call than we typically have. I called at the right time. But if you have any feedback at all of how I could how
123. [Prospect]  I don't know. You know? I you already kinda had me Nook is already generally on my Wide range radar. So you kinda caught caught the right guy

125. [Prospect]  at a time where I actually picked up the phone and had a moment to pick up the phone.
