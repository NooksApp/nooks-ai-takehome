I So, yeah, I was reaching out to you specifically because I know, yeah, just with, like, that volume of cold calls, I know, like, I'm talking to folks every day, Paul, about this where it's like Connect rates are down across all the different industries, and so reps end up spending extra time listening to the ringtone instead of having live conversations, which is, You know, obviously, harder to book meetings, to ramp, all of that good stuff.
15. [Prospect]  Yeah.
16. [Sales Rep]  And so is that, like, I mean, jeez, 1st day back. Is this is this a terrible time for us to be talking? Like, I know you You were gonna see a demo just to get your eyes on it to know if it was even worth, like, starting any kind of dialogue internally around it.
