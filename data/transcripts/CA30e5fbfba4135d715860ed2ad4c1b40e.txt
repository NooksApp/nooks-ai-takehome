9. [Prospect]  Yeah.
10. [Sales Rep]  Awesome. How are how are your reps going about that in the moment? Do they use, say, like, their their CRM or, like, a SalesLoft Outreach to get that done.
11. [Prospect]  Yeah. We use Outreach.
12. [Sales Rep]  Heard. Gotcha. So I'll just share a few challenges we're hearing from from other teams like your that are cold calling o j. So, taking a lot more connects to actually or or connect rates are low, and it's taking a lot more dials to to drive meaningful pipeline than it was in the past. In response, we're seeing a ton of activity gaps between reps. So only some reps on the team are actually putting in, You know, enough dials every day to drive meaningful pipe. In addition to that, it can can be a little bit difficult with those disconnect rates and other issues to to pivot and enable on messaging for the team without listening to every call one after the other. Does any of that that sit with you or a challenge you're facing or am I totally off track with that?
13. [Prospect]  I mean, it sounds about right. But, I'm kind of in between meetings. I have to catch up on a few things. If you could, I think maybe sending me an email outlining kind know what you guys offer. I can shoot up, you know, the chain and see if there's any traction.
