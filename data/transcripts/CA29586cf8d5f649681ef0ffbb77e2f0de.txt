1. [Prospect]  Hi. This is Nicole.
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Nicole. Cameron over at notes. How's your Wednesday going?
3. [Prospect]  Hey. Good. Thank you. How are you?
4. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. I'm good. I I really appreciate you asking. Thanks as well. I just, I really only had 1 question to start for you. I have you as a BDR director over at Meredith. I I was curious if if cold calling outbound cold Calling is also important to your to your own top of funnel
5. [Prospect]  I am a sales director For outbound sales, not inside sales, if that's that's what you meant. But, yes, we we do have to cold call, but it's on a finite list, if you will. We call it the government clients specifically. So why Can I just cut to the chase? What why? Why are you asking?
6. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I mean, I I I think if it's like a super finite list, it it might might not make sense to chat that much further. You know, I don't know if there's different teams there that are higher volume, but, essentially, you know, a lot of SCR leaders are sharing that Connect rates are low. It's taking more work now than it used to to get prospects on the phone. And, You know, how we help teams is with the calling platform that, you know, includes ways that you can look into where your data is falling short, but also a parallel dialer. So, kind of
7. [Prospect]  Yeah. So I'm I'm sorry to talk over you. Let me just share what what is So you may or may not be aware that Meredith's, like, pretty close to a brand new company, like, probably about a year and a half now. And We the company did just implement something similar, I think, to what you're talking about called SalesLoft, And we're going through a Sandler methodology workshop. So we have a tool now that folks at It's not really our business. It's something we have. Meredith is broken up into 6 pillars. So I'm in the government Like, social program space. If you look online, there's also other pillars that are, like, related to imaging, clinical trials. I think that there is definitely a higher volume of outreach and cold calling in the other pillars. So across Meredith, they implemented this tool. All the calls and the outreach goes through this tool. You can manage cadence scripts put together, like, a schedule, if you will, for the cadence. And I know that's being used heavily by inside Sales as well as some of the, kinda outside sales reps in the other pillars. So is that is that what you're talking about? Is that The type of solution that you you sell
8. [Sales Rep]  A little bit. So, Yeah. We use SalesLoft as well, and we, actually, we integrate with SalesLoft. So I think even with that tool, what a lot of times People run into dialing out of that is that you know, a a rep might sit down for 2 hours, make 50 to a 100 cold calls, but only, You know, 1 of 1, 2, 3 of those people pick up the phone. So,
9. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah.
10. [Sales Rep]  you know, a lot of that time is wasted. Most of the time, a rep is actually gonna be listening to the ringtone instead of having conversations, whereas we're just gonna accelerate that dialing motion, and only connect reps to the people who pick up the phone and kind of handle that that TaskRabbit Work that that logging task work, in the back end for them.
11. [Prospect]  Yes. Well, what I can do, if if you would like, is if you wanna send me an email with a description of what you have. Like, I don't I don't know if what you mentioned if if what we have goes as far as that, but I'm happy to pass it along to our operations folks. And if If there's interested in chatting with you, I could have someone follow-up.
12. [Sales Rep]  Cool. Yeah. I'm happy to send, like, a a high level overview over your way. If you were to, like, point in one direction, I think what, you know, what what sector or what pillar do you think would be Kind of the the highest volume when it comes to calling. Would that be like folks calling into health providers? Or
13. [Prospect]  Probably. I mean, I guess maybe if I had to pick Gwen, I'd say maybe our health insights pillar. But, again, I I actually probably wouldn't call into any one pillar, and I try to get More into our business operations team that sits across the
14. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
15. [Prospect]  you know? And I think that's
16. [Sales Rep]  Absolutely.
17. [Prospect]  And that SalesLoft implementation is quite new, by the way. It's, like, 6 months new. So yeah. So that's what I mean. Like, the timing is just, I I don't know if, you know, perhaps what we already have has what you're talking about as well. I just don't know.
18. [Sales Rep]  Right. I see.
19. [Prospect]  I'm happy to inquire.
20. [Sales Rep]  Cool. Well, I will get that, I'll get that overview over your way. And and I really appreciate you taking the call today.
21. [Prospect]  Yes, sir. Do you have my email? That's
22. [Sales Rep]  I have it as nrath@meritiv.com. Is that right?
23. [Prospect]  yes. Okay.
