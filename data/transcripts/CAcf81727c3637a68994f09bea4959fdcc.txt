1. [Prospect]  Hi. This is Zach.
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Zach. Skyler with Nook. So I was just hoping for, like, 30 seconds real quick.
3. [Prospect]  Sure. Got it.
4. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I appreciate it.
5. [Prospect]  Yep.
6. [Sales Rep]  So not sure if this is super relevant. Saw you were in enterprise sales for NAMI Health. Do you have reps making, like, cold calls by any chance, or is it more of, like, inbound or, like, email focused?
7. [Prospect]  Nope. Neither. We, We are just client expansion right now. So it's very much just yep.
8. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Gotcha. Do you know if NAMI has anybody, like, on the,
9. [Prospect]  No.
10. [Sales Rep]  maybe, like, the outbound side of things, like, a different department by any chance?
11. [Prospect]  Are you an outsourced, account development team or BDR team?
12. [Sales Rep]  No. So I'm not. So, essentially, we have a tool called NUCs. It's pretty cool. I don't know if you guys, like, your outbound team dials 1 at a time. Essentially, Nook will, like, hook up to your engagement platform. And instead of spending, like, all day listening to the phone ring, I can have, like, 10 to 20 conversations an hour.
13. [Prospect]  Sure.
14. [Sales Rep]  Basically, I hit dial and I get a connect pretty quick. Saves me, like, a ton of time.
15. [Prospect]  Yep. We we really don't have a, large dialing shop here. So I don't think we're interested.
16. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. No worries. Just One last question, then I promise I'll let you go.
17. [Prospect]  Mhmm.
18. [Sales Rep]  Is it do you think it's like the ICP? Like, is that the reason why? Like, they don't do a lot of dialing or have they just, like, Not found it successful in the past. Just kinda curious about that.
19. [Prospect]  Yeah. A lot of it is ICP for sure.
20. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. Well, hey. I appreciate you taking my callback. Yep. Thanks. You too.
