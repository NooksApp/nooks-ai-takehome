1. [Prospect]  Right. Copeland.
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Brad. How's your, how's your Friday going?
3. [Prospect]  Good. If I knew how I was talking to you, I could even be more specific.
4. [Sales Rep]  So my name is Patrick. I'm actually calling from over at Nook's, and this is totally a cold call. But if you got 30 seconds from me, I'd love to tell you Well, I reached out to you, and if you hate it, you can feel free to hang up on me. Does that sound like a a pretty good deal?
5. [Prospect]  I won't hang up on you, but I'll tell you that our call is over. But what is NUCs? Sounds delicious.
6. [Sales Rep]  Yes. So it is it's pretty tasty depending on if you like pipeline generation or not. So, basically, what Nook's does is we're helping your Team of SDRs, AEs, whoever's really cold calling, increase the amount of conversations they're having and how much activity they're doing by, like, Typically, what we see in a trial over 2 weeks is like 3 to 5 x. So 3 to 5 x conversations,
7. [Prospect]  Mhmm.
8. [Sales Rep]  3 to 5 x meetings which is the goal, and there's also an enablement component and some other cool stuff around it, but wanna take a step back. Like, how important is cold calling in your guys' pipeline generation strategy at
9. [Prospect]  Well, just so you know, I will my last day of product stuff will be on the 29th, which is next week. And cold calling is important, And it is a lost art form, but it's also hard to get people's numbers.
10. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha.
11. [Prospect]  So just like you're calling me on my cell phone, which is a rather sacrosanct number,
12. [Sales Rep]  Mhmm.
13. [Prospect]  That's part of the challenge, and a lot of people get, I think a little bit, not concerned, but frustrated that people have their cell phones. And so it is a challenge. What I'll tell you is we're going through a massive tech stack review, and much like a lot of
14. [Sales Rep]  Mhmm.
15. [Prospect]  scale ups, we're really mindful of what we spend our funds on. So, you gotta have a pretty compelling event and it's gotta sit within the stack already, and most likely, A Gong IO or a Outreach or one of the vendors that we already do business with is building or has an extension. So that's what you're kind of up against. The person you need to speak to is Wesley
16. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yep.
17. [Prospect]  Husted, but guess what, it's not in your territory because it's in Berlin,
18. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. So Wesley owns All Tools and he's he's just out of he's just out of Berlin.
19. [Prospect]  Germany. That's right. So, knowing the way that U. S. Companies are structured, you either have a counterpart or you're going to go after it, but
20. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha.
21. [Prospect]  Wesley is a BDR Leader,
22. [Sales Rep]  Mhmm.
23. [Prospect]  and that's where that all sits.
24. [Sales Rep]  Got it. So I I'm gonna go ahead and reach out to Wesley. And knowing that he's in Berlin, I'm probably gonna hold off on calling you. And I I know the rules in general, so I'll probably just shoot him over an email. I got a question, Brad. Like, this is kind of a a Hail Mary, and I know you're leaving on the 29th. Would you be open at all to, introducing not with an endorsement, but just, hey, making the connection here with and I could ghostwrite you something so that it's, easy for you to send over.
25. [Prospect]  Absolutely,
26. [Sales Rep]  Yeah? Appreciate that, Brad. I'll, I'll get that in your inbox.
27. [Prospect]  And your 2nd sequence is Brad asked me to call you.
28. [Sales Rep]  Got it. I'm on it.
29. [Prospect]  So, you got the 1st sequences I'm writing and on your behalf, the second one is you're gonna say Brad asked for me to speak to you.
30. [Sales Rep]  Absolutely. Absolutely. And then, Brad, where where are you headed? Are you do you have your next next thing lined up?
31. [Prospect]  I do, I have my own business. So, I'm an investor, and I'm gonna be taking over as the president and CRO of one of my companies.
32. [Sales Rep]  That's exciting, man. That's really exciting.
33. [Prospect]  It is. Yeah. After 30 years, you know, kinda doing it for myself and and not the same nonsense of dealing with boards and All the things you gotta deal with deal with. But now I'm my own board, and I'll put the own pressure on myself rather than someone doing it to me.
34. [Sales Rep]  Yep. Absolutely. Well,
35. [Prospect]  Well, best of luck to
36. [Sales Rep]  yeah. Appreciate it, Brad. I'll get that in your Inbox so that you can just forward it over to Wesley, but really appreciate your time, man. And, yeah, you'll you'll hear from me shortly.
37. [Prospect]  you. Perfect.
