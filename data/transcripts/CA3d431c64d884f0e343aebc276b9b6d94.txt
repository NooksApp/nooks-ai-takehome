1. [Prospect]  Hello. Sean speaking.
2. [Sales Rep]  Sean, this is Josh with Nooks. Happy almost Friday. How's it going?
3. [Prospect]  It's it's doing great, man. How are you doing?
4. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. Sean, I, Look. I know I'm probably catching you mid coffee sip here. Do you have 30 seconds? If I missed the mark, I'll just throw my phone at the wall.
5. [Prospect]  I, you know, I I I know how hard it is to go with calls. I I literally have 2 minutes before I jump into my next meeting, so you got 2 minutes
6. [Sales Rep]  Okay. That's totally fair. I appreciate you, man. Thank you so much. I I'll cut to the chase then. I'm reaching out because I know, yeah, Courtney, your director over there, we were in chats with her earlier in the year, about making outbound cold calls. Is that something that your team is is pretty heavy on right now? I know it sounds like you guys do a lot of emailing, but do you have a team that's making outbound cold calls as well?
7. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm I'm very familiar with Nook's. I'm actually a fan, so what I can do is just float it up to Courtney. I I'm not part of the decision making process, But what I can do is load it up to see if it's a conversation that could be sparked up. So,
8. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
9. [Prospect]  I can do that much.
10. [Sales Rep]  Amazing. Let me, slap me on the wrist, Sean, if this is asking too much here, but If you're a fan, it's been a while. Have you ever seen Nook's? Like, have you ever demoed the platform?
11. [Prospect]  Hi. I haven't personally demoed it, but I have been a part of a few of the, LinkedIn live cold calls where they're using NUCs. So that's my experience to it.
12. [Sales Rep]  Oh, let's go. Let's go.
13. [Prospect]  Yeah.
14. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Amazing. I mean, if you're not opposed, let's throw you into a demo and you can see it for yourself. And then if you think it's even worse, like, Throwing it up to, to Courtney. Does that seem fair?
15. [Prospect]  Yeah. I mean, I I I think it's I I I I I see the value of it already.
16. [Sales Rep]  Or you mean what's that?
17. [Prospect]  Putting me in a demo wouldn't necessarily do anything since I'm not
18. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
19. [Prospect]  Gonna be part of the decision making process. So I can bring it up to Courtney. And if you what I if you wanna do what what you can do is if you wanna send me an email so I can get contact info.
