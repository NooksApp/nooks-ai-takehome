1. [Prospect]  Hello. This is John.
2. [Sales Rep]  Hi. This hey, John. This is Daniel with Nook's. I'll be honest, man. This is totally a cold call. Do you mind hearing me out for a few moments?
3. [Prospect]  Sure.
4. [Sales Rep]  Appreciate that, man. So I'll be really brief. I know that you are leading an SDR team at Cisco. At least that's the data that I still have for you. And, we I'm actually calling you with Nook's. It's a software that, is basically an AI that's doing all the dialing for me, and I'm not doing any dialing on my own. And you're like by 14th connect over the past hour because it's dialing up to 5 people at the same time. And so, it's a very effective way of of doing less work to get more pipeline. If if you have reps that are doing cold calls already, is that relevant at all?
5. [Prospect]  Yeah. But we we already use a dialing tool, and I don't we think we just adopted it, like, a year ago, And I think we signed a 2 or 3 year deal, so it's not something we're reevaluating anytime soon.
6. [Sales Rep]  I see. I imagine it's Orem.
7. [Prospect]  No. We're using Dialpad.
8. [Sales Rep]  Oh, Dialpad. Oh, so this is a bit different. It's not exactly like a like a Dialpad Solution. It's more so like an enhancement on top of Outreach or SalesLoft. And basically, It just pulls in, like, all of your prospects that you would otherwise call, and then you can call them 5 x at a time and an AI determines whether it's a voice mail or a live Pickup. And then when the AI determines that it's a real person, it it connects me to them just like what happened here. And so if you have if you're doing like 70 cold calls a day per rep, let's say, that typically takes a couple of hours to do. And in Nook's you can do that in like 30 minutes and, and get like 3 x the actual conversations to convert to meetings. And then it's all happening in a virtual workspace that's purpose built for team cold calling hours, And so the reps can actually hear each other too when they get into those conversations. For example, my my SDR team is actually listening to this right now.
9. [Prospect]  Cool. But, yeah, like I said, we're we're just not not looking to reevaluate tools anytime soon. I mean, we took a look at Aurum, when we looked at Dialpad, and we decided that the the multi dialing,
10. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. No worries. Take care.
