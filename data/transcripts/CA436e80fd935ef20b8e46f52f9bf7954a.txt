2. [Sales Rep]  Hi. Is this Garrett?
3. [Prospect]  Yep.
4. [Sales Rep]  I think you already said that. Hey, Garrett. Hey. This is Daniel with Nook's. We spoke earlier in the year when we were still a seed stage smaller org. We've tripled in size. We've raised Series A. Our product continues to move upmarket. And, we're an AI that optimize that Automates 90% of cold calling the parts that people hate to do, so people really transform their pipeline outcomes with our software. And I'm just wondering if this time of year well, actually, I think in my notes you mentioned that to reach back out later in the year. It's been about 8 ish months and so I just wanted to reach back out and see if, if maybe you're interested in taking a closer look at what we do, which is, transformed tremendously since I first called
5. [Prospect]  Yeah. Good. I mean, I don't have the ability to make any decisions or anything like that. That would all be done through our revenue operations team. I actually have a meeting tomorrow with, people from that team. Could you send me over some information that I can relay over to them? And if that's something that they're interested in. I can get you in contact with
6. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I'll send something over. We've got a lot of stuff that we could send over, so I wanna make sure I send over the most relevant material that I can. I guess, I I'm I'm imagining
7. [Prospect]  Is it does it
8. [Sales Rep]  What's that?
9. [Prospect]  well, I was asked, Does it go does it interact integrate directly with, HubSpot?
10. [Sales Rep]  It does. Yeah. So you can it basically so you put prospects and contact lists in HubSpot, and then it's a 5 second sync. It literally takes, like, 5 seconds when you're in Nooks, and then it pulls all the prospects in a given contact list. And you can call them 5 x at a time. And if you connect rates, you know, what it normally is for a SaaS company, the end result is the reps are they're not actually doing the cold calls anymore, yet they're in, like, Three x conversations in a given power hour.
11. [Prospect]  Okay. Yeah. If you could send over information on how, like, it integrates with HubSpot and, I mean, we also use Zoom Phone. Those are our 2 kinda platforms for call in.
12. [Sales Rep]  Okay. We would be the dialer in this case for that. Yeah. I'll send that over. We would be the the dialer in this case, So you wouldn't use Zoom phone? You would dial with us and and, to to do that to have the that effect.
13. [Prospect]  If you can send over information.
14. [Sales Rep]  But, yeah, I'll put all this together
15. [Prospect]  Okay. Yeah. I'll let you know, just so you know, we just went into contract about 3 months ago with Zoom Phone.
16. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. And that's and that was strictly for for outbound calling or from or or for other use cases?
17. [Prospect]  So, for outbound calling, and other use cases.
18. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Yeah. I mean, most people that are using Zoom Phone, they are doing a lot of Cases with it and they they'll just use Nook's since we have the AI that can that can offer these, like this productivity boost. But, yeah, I'll include all that in the email and, and, yeah. When when do you when, you know, when would I hear back from you, I guess, if you're talking tomorrow?
19. [Prospect]  Yeah. If you wanna send me over that information, I can forward it over me see if they're interested, and then I'll get you a call either, tomorrow or Friday.
