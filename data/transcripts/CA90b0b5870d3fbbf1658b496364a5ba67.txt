1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Christina. This is Daniel with Nook's. How's it going?
3. [Prospect]  Good. How are you?
4. [Sales Rep]  I'm doing great. Thanks for asking. Hey. So is it okay if I level you level with you really quickly about why I called? I
5. [Prospect]  Sure.
6. [Sales Rep]  appreciate that. I'll be super brief. So I know that you are a BDR manager At Modus, and we work with a lot of BDR managers who tell us one of 2 things. So one being In a remote environment or hybrid environment, it can be tough to really get the absolute best from reps when they're doing cold calls like this. And then the other thing is that, they they it's hard to get numbers up when connect rates are relatively low even with good data quality. I'm just wondering if either of those things resonate with you at all?
7. [Prospect]  Probably more the connects. We have, like, less than a 2% connect. Right? It's probably here in the Oh, maybe. But yeah.
8. [Sales Rep]  Got it. Okay. So my that makes sense. Okay. Yeah. So, actually, That might be an area where we can help because we talked to a lot of folks that, you know, they're struggling with these low connect rates like I was saying. I'll explain to you exactly how we do that. So I'm actually using our platform to call you right now, and it was doing all the dialing for me. Was dialing multiple people at once, and the AI detected that you were a live pickup. And so literally over the past, like, 30 minutes, when we started our calling block, It's already made, like, 60, 70 dials for me, and you're like my 10th conversation. And that's again, like, it's doing all the work for me, essentially, and I just have to focus On having more conversations just like this one. So the impact it has on on rep's product what's that?
9. [Prospect]  Yep. We thing like this, it sounds like. You guys are a competitor to Orem, would you say?
10. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. 100%. Most people that that already have Orem, when they find out about us And they trial us. They find that not only is our platform more stable, bridge times are faster, that whole sort of thing, but also we're significantly less expensive.
11. [Prospect]  Okay. I mean, I don't make decisions like this, but I know we're evaluating Orem now. I don't really know where it sits because Right now, we just don't, like, have budget for it. So I think we're trying to build budget out. But, I would say to get with Aaron. He's our director of business development. You can give him a call and, you know, you can say that I referred you to him. But, he's He's looking into these types of things right now. But, again, like, I just can't promise that, like, it's gonna like, anything's gonna happen with it Just because they I don't know where that project is right now because for budget purpose I don't know if it's been on pause or what's going on with it.
12. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. Makes total sense. Actually, I'm in the I'm in the room right now with, well, I'm in the we have a virtual sales floor piece Where my entire team is just actually shadowing this call in real time. That's also what we do. And I'm actually joined right now by One of Orem's top sales reps who recently left Orem, because we're just taking a lot of their business essentially, and he wanted to join Nook's. So I think it would end up being a pretty fruitful conversation with Aaron. Can you help me? Like, what's Aaron's last name just so that I can I can find him on LinkedIn?
13. [Prospect]  Yeah. I mean, if you search sales, he said our b business development director.
14. [Sales Rep]  Oh, is it Alfred Fieri?
15. [Prospect]  Yeah.
16. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Awesome. Yeah. I think I found him. Great. Well, I appreciate I think we're already connected on LinkedIn, actually. Awesome. Okay. And are you guys on Outreach or SalesLoft?
17. [Prospect]  We're on outreach today.
18. [Sales Rep]  Outreach. Got it. And without before trialing, how many dials per day would the reps typically
19. [Prospect]  Right now, we're at, like, 400 dials a week. That equates to about 80 a day. So we we like to have our BDRs at about 80 to a 100 a day, I would say.
20. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Got it. And is LinkedIn big for you guys? Like like, seeing LinkedIn profile information, is that is that really helpful for personalizing?
21. [Prospect]  I I mean, a little bit. Yeah. We we trialed Orem before, and I know, like, we were just figuring out, like, how to make it optimal and, you know, just trialing something for the 1st time. They were they didn't really like the multiple die. Like, If you dial, like, 10 people at once and one picks up, they didn't really like that. They like the single or, like, I think it was a double dialer. I forget what it was called. But, Yeah. Definitely trialed that stuff, and I think the links were helpful. Outreach notes are helpful, you know, syncing into Salesforce, all that stuff like that. So
22. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. We we do all of that except, One one big feedback that we've gotten recently is that since we actually do like, we automate the LinkedIn research the rep doesn't even have to go to LinkedIn when the connect happens. It's just all there. Like, I have your entire LinkedIn in front of me in the Nooks UI as we speak. So do you think I mean, like, I think based on what you're telling me, like, a lot of calls per day on Outreach, You guys seem like the ideal people that would want like, that would get interest in, like, a more cost effective version of Orem. That's also just more reliable from, like, a platform stability standpoint. So would it be crazy to, You know, put 15 minutes on on the calendar on Monday, and we just, like, show you and get you and get some more context on whether or not this would actually be worthwhile. Because so far, It sounds like it actually would. And what I don't want to happen is then we just rely on reaching out to Aaron, like, digitally and then we never reach him and then There's a big missed opportunity both ways because it sounds like if you're evaluating and you're trying to make budget, it's gonna be a lot more easy with NUCs because We're half the price of
23. [Prospect]  Yeah. We don't have any meetings scheduled with you guys. Modus hasn't scheduled any meetings with you guys before. I know you've evaluated a couple of forum competitors. So I just I don't know if I've heard the name, Nook, or if we've done An evaluation with you guys before, are you able to see that?
24. [Sales Rep]  So I can see the history right now in Nook's with MODIS, the account, as I'm talking to you. And actually, I cold called Aaron, a few months ago. And what I but what I have here in the notes is that Aaron recommended just reach out More in, like, January or February, because he said that that was when it wouldn't start making more sense and that he was interested. So I think there's that actually. And I guess what this means is that you guys ended up taking a look at dialers before that after all. So maybe it is even, like, maybe it is great timing now to to take a closer look. But that's the so far the history we have. It turns out I actually Called Aaron in the past a couple of months ago, and that's what he said.
25. [Prospect]  Okay. If you send me an email, I could forward it to him and, like because like I said, I mean, just meeting with me isn't really gonna do anything. I'm bought into the idea of getting something. So, I mean, ultimately, we have to get him looped in anyways. So let's let's go that route. If you send me an email, I'll forward it to him, have a conversation with him about when we wanna do something like that. Like I said, he's spearheading all that as far as timing goes and working through that with finance. So if he told you January, I mean, maybe it is actually January. I really don't know, and stuff like that. So, you know, it might genuinely just be the case because we I don't see us getting ORMs, Like, at before the end of this year, anyways. So, but it might make sense. So, yeah, send me an email. I'll I'll cc you in it, and we could kind of go that route. Because like I said, I just, I I just don't think it's gonna do anything if if I meet without him, and I'd rather pull him in the meeting anyways if we do meet.
26. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. 100%. Totally get that. So give me a second here. So just so that I have it right, your email is cdrosos@modis?
27. [Prospect]  Yeah.
28. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Perfect. I will send an email out to both of you. I have Aaron's email as well. And I'll just include, like, a a link with, like, an executive summary, essentially, of of what we do. It'll be pretty self explanatory. And, yeah, I guess I'll I'll ping you again. Like, I'll just respond via email again, like, on Monday or something or towards the end of the week if I don't hear back just to see what the outcome was. But appreciate your time.
29. [Prospect]  Yeah. Thanks so much. I I appreciate the call.
30. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Thanks.
