1. [Prospect]  Hello? Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Brian. Hey, Brian. This is, This is Cameron over at Nook's. Totally appreciate I'm catching you out of the blue. Did I catch you at a terrible time? Hey. I just saw I I have you as a VP of sales over at at Meredith. I didn't know if you were still there or not. Do you have, Either account executives that you're overseeing, that are placed in outbound cold calls or or reps that are doing so to drive top of funnel? I see. Okay. How do they go about that today? Is that like a a sales loft or an outreach? Some kind of,
3. [Prospect]  Yeah. It's for sale block.
4. [Sales Rep]  Oh, great. Okay. Yeah. Reason I reached out, I actually reached you with my software. So, Brian, I'm talking to VPs of sales and heads of sales dev every day. And I I think what I've been hearing most is that the phone is kind of becoming a a harder channel to book on. Connect rates are lower. Some reps because of that are kinda shying away from using the phone as a channel as a whole. Is that something that you've been seeing, I guess, declining up a funnel from the phone as an outlet or might totally off the wrong
5. [Prospect]  Yes. It depends. It's sent on the client, but, you know, we're doing email campaigns massively through SalesLoft.
6. [Sales Rep]  Right. So you're heading for kind of multichannel email campaigns along with the cold calls.
7. [Prospect]  Correct. Well, that's 2 different teams. So yes.
8. [Sales Rep]  Oh, I see. Interesting. Okay. Yeah. I'll share with you how I reached you. I don't know if it would be relevant to your team that does outbound cold calling, but, Basically, in response to those connect rates and and just still the phone being the fastest path to revenue, instead of, you know, Dialing 1 by 1 and putting myself in a position where I can spend 2 hours calling and and really just listen to the ringtone. What our software does is just connect your reps and your outbounders to folks who who pick up the phone live like yourself. It handles the tedious stuff on the back end, so that, you know, your reps can stay dialed in with conversations, instead of logging no call tasks and listening to the ringtone. Typically, it's 2 to 3 x ing the at bats that a that a good rep can have in a day if they're doing those call blitzes. Have you, have you looked into anything like that in the past? Or
9. [Prospect]  No. But it I I don't honestly that's a Totally separate organization. I don't handle that piece.
10. [Sales Rep]  Oh, okay. You're overseeing more of the email email side?
11. [Prospect]  No. I I have Run the sales organization on the outside sales.
12. [Sales Rep]  Right. Okay. Are are you close with whoever's leading BDRs and and those heavy outbounders over at Meredith, or Should I keep alright.
13. [Prospect]  No. I'm not.
14. [Sales Rep]  Alright. Well, Brian, I appreciate you fielding the call at least and and taking it.
15. [Prospect]  You
