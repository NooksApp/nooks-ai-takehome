1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Tom. It's Patrick calling from over at. How's your Wednesday going?
3. [Prospect]  Good. What company?
4. [Sales Rep]  I'm calling from a company called, Nook's, and I I can I can be straight to the point? And if you give me 20 seconds. I wanna tell you exactly why I'm calling you, and you can feel free to hang up with me if you think it sounds totally irrelevant. Does that sound like a no.
5. [Prospect]  Alright.
6. [Sales Rep]  Cool. So I was doing some research,
7. [Prospect]  Perfect.
8. [Sales Rep]  on your team over at Emoney Advisor, and it looks like your team is pretty heavily invested in, you know, an outbound pipeline generation team. And, really, what we're helping teams do, Tom, is help your BERs and AEs and anybody that's generating pipeline over the phone Get more connects on the phone through parallel dialing as well as, especially if the team is remote, or even in office, providing a virtual sales floor that's injecting a lot of energy and fun into actually making calls. So the culture there just improves. We get more dials. We get more connects and, Ultimately, generate more pipeline for your business. So, Tom, I wanna take a step back really quickly. Is cold calling a big piece of your guys' pipeline generation strategy? Or is this falling on Deaf ears.
9. [Prospect]  It's not the biggest piece of our pipeline generation, but Every sales organization does some level of it. So it's not, I know what you're talking about. That's for sure.
10. [Sales Rep]  Yep. Yeah. Well, I'm I'm curious, like, how focused is, your team focused on pipeline generated? Do you guys have, like, a team of of SCRs that's mainly focused on it, or is the team full cycle? Like, what is the what is the breakdown of the team look like?
11. [Prospect]  Yeah. So, I'm not sure that that's your Beth, first question. I'll be honest with you. Like because, like, how we do it, I'm not sure where this is going. I I if It so it sounds like what you offer is some sort of improved connection rate and, some sort of, Gamification or contest driven things tied to KPIs probably around calling. Right? So it's not anything to do with making your calls the actual call themselves more Effective. It sounds like it's improving connection rate and thought. Am I right?
12. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I mean, that's a piece of it, but we're also we're also have, like like, deep audio and language models running in the background to, like, help you guys gather more enablement Data so that you can take that to the team and turn more of those conversations into higher conversions, into meetings booked. So I think you you you hit the nail on the head for the most part. I mean, we're helping your team log more activities. We're helping your team get more at bats on those cold calls. We're helping your enablement team understand What's happening there so they can increase conversions on that stuff. And then the last piece of that is it's a virtual sales force. It's not really competition based. It's much more for Instead of your team sitting on Zoom calls or, you know, even doing it in a conference room, like, giving them a a real place that was natively built for Seems to make cold calls so that they can, you know, run it and then on the fly. Managers can help their teams through certain calls. There's a level of communication there that can happen on call. So I I think, you know yep.
13. [Prospect]  Yep. Alright. Here's here's what I would offer as a constructive thought for you. If you're recording this, maybe play back and listen to it. You you said you asked for 26 seconds. I said sure. You led off with 2 points. 1 was, parallel dialing, and one was, making it more fun. Right?
14. [Sales Rep]  Yep. Mhmm.
15. [Prospect]  You that was your short window of time in 26 seconds. Those were the 2 functions. Those were the 2 things you highlighted. Then after I said, man, I don't know that this is, you listed off 4 others that were much more impactful to people like me That, just for you in the future, lead with those 4. These were the good 4. The first 2, I had no care in the world whether you use parallel dialing Or whether it's fun. So as you make your calls, use the 4 that matter and not the 2 that you led this with. Does that make sense?
16. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. That's super helpful. I mean, it's it's it's not easy to always know exactly what's important, but it sounds like, you know, That's ultimately where I should focus is in those in in the metric.
17. [Prospect]  Hey. You had that that you moved into a good elevator speech, 30 seconds. This is how we impact your business. The first 2 weren't your good ones. They just weren't.
18. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. Gotcha. That's super helpful.
19. [Prospect]  So good luck. Yeah. Good luck. You know, it's tough doing what you do. I appreciate, You know, the the you honing your craft, I'm not interested,
20. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
21. [Prospect]  but, you know, take, It's probably worth what I you paid for. It was free advice.
22. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, Tom, I mean, I I do have 1 more question. I I I know it sounds like it's not something you're interested in looking at. If we were able to increase those metrics that we talked about and make that impact on your business, is there somebody that I should be reaching out to where it's really relevant for them and we can help, you know, Them hit their goals better to to increase the pipeline generation for your team over there.
23. [Prospect]  Yeah. I I'm not, like, I you've reached the right area. I just don't it's not, like, we're not, driven that's not our most burning platform.
24. [Sales Rep]  Okay. I gotcha. Thanks,
25. [Prospect]  Cool.
26. [Sales Rep]  Tom, I appreciate it so much. Thanks again for the tips. And, yes, if things do change, I'll shoot you over a LinkedIn connection request, and, feel free to reach out there. And Let's
27. [Prospect]  Alright.
