1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hi. Is this Tavon?
3. [Prospect]  Yes.
4. [Sales Rep]  Tavon, hi. This is Daniel with Nook's. I'll be totally honest, this is a cold call. Do you mind hearing me on for just a few moments?
5. [Prospect]  Sure.
6. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I appreciate that. So, what we actually do Is so we're an AI that allows salespeople to not have to cold call, like sales development representatives. I'm actually using it. Was using it to call you right now. It made, like, 300 dials for me over the past 2 hours. And you're like my 16th, 17th conversation of that period of time. And so what it allows SDR teams to do is basically not have to spend more effort and time on wasteful cold calling. And instead, the AI is just throwing up conversations and opportunities to set more meetings much more often throughout the day. It has a pretty dramatic impact on people's line. So I was just wondering if you if you're, like, the right person for that. The data I have here is that you're a manager of global biz dev. Yeah. I mean, is it based on my pitch, is that something you'd like to check out?
7. [Prospect]  I mean, I will definitely be somebody that would use something like that, but I wouldn't be a decision maker in that sense.
8. [Sales Rep]  I see.
9. [Prospect]  Yeah. So I have My boss would be pretty much the decision to make around that. We have explored tools similar to that, and we We haven't really moved forward with it, so I'm not sure what the prospects are for something like that. I know right now our focus is mainly on kinda getting traction around cold calling with our team, and kinda enable them to be able to make cold calls and feel confident in making those calls. I think once we kinda get past that portion of it, because we're really a email LinkedIn heavy outbound team at this point,
10. [Sales Rep]  Right.
11. [Prospect]  And we're trying to push more cold calls. But I don't know if we would invest in something Until we have that that sort of foundation
12. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
13. [Prospect]  for our team.
14. [Sales Rep]  That actually makes perfect sense. I totally hear you, instead of the dialer that we offer so I guess I'll also explain this. So I'm actually I'm onboarding some brand new SDRs on my team that we're trying to do the same thing, increase their confidence on the phones. And the way that I'm doing that right now with them is they're actually in the product With me because Nooks also has a virtual co working space that's purpose built for team cold calling. And so these new hires, they're actually listening to me right now. And they and they can hear this conversation in real time. And so just from, like, the past couple of weeks, like, they feel Dramatically, like, improved with ability to cold call and be more confident with it when they see how I'm doing it. So that's what we do. So maybe the dialer wouldn't make sense, but, I mean, what if we set up some time, like 10, 15 minutes tomorrow or Thursday, and we show you this?
15. [Prospect]  That's that's good. Let me see. What about Thursday?
16. [Sales Rep]  Thursday. So can you do, let's see let's see. Can you do 5 PM EST on Thursday?
17. [Prospect]  I can't do 5 PM, but I am free between 2 and 4.
18. [Sales Rep]  2 and 4. Okay. Yeah. Can you do 230?
19. [Prospect]  That works.
20. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Cool. I'll send something your way, and I I've got thayes@usertesting.com. Is that right?
21. [Prospect]  That's right.
22. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Perfect, man. Well, I'll send that your way. Give me, like, 5 seconds here. Wanna make sure I'm spelling your name right. Oh, awesome, man. Well, I've sent that out to you. Oh, you go by Tay, don't you? Okay. I see.
