1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Alex. Ken over at Nook. How's it going?
3. [Prospect]  I I missed your name. Who's this?
4. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. My name is Cameron, and I'll aim to be super brief here, Alex. Been speaking to other SCR and BDR leaders almost every day, and, I think one of the common levers that I'm hearing that they have to pull pull is improving connect rates. I actually just got off the phone with 1 director earlier this morning who said just this summer, theirs is falling from 6 to 2%. So their reps are Essentially, having to put in, like, 300% of the activity that they were to hopefully drive kind of similar results. Now I know that that's like a crazy, drastic example. Might not be the case for your team, but but have you seen any anything kind of similar to that or am I Totally off track
5. [Prospect]  No. You're not off track, but who did you say your wrist camera?
6. [Sales Rep]  here. I'm with a company called Nook's. It's like books with an n.
7. [Prospect]  What what does your company provide?
8. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. So, essentially, what we do is, help connect your reps simply to the prospects who who pick up the phone. Typically when folks trial with us and then come on board, they're They're having 3 3 times the conversations with their prospects than they are if they're, like, single dialing or reaching out 1 by 1. We're a sales floor in the parallel dialer, and we have a lot of levers that we can pull for that connect rate as well. Have you have you
9. [Prospect]  So are you like are you like concert?
10. [Sales Rep]  like concert?
11. [Prospect]  Yes.
12. [Sales Rep]  I I'd say concert. Yeah. They're they're kind of in our wheelhouse. More more of the time when we come up against someone, it's it's Orem. Are are you, currently using Concert?
13. [Prospect]  I've used both Orm and Concert, but I haven't heard of you,
14. [Sales Rep]  Okay.
15. [Prospect]  which is which is fine. How long have y'all been around?
16. [Sales Rep]  We've been around since 2019, but we Started, kinda right at the moment of the pandemic. So we started as just a virtual sales floor and we weren't, You know, we hadn't really honed in the ICP of SDR and BDR teams. It it's only been about since October of last year, that we brought on the Parallel Dialer functionality, and a lot of the other tools that are helping SDR teams. Yeah. Yeah. That's the I guess that's it. Sorry.
17. [Prospect]  How did you, how did you get my info?
18. [Sales Rep]  Zoom info.
19. [Prospect]  Okay. Gotcha. No. I I appreciate it, but, let me be fully transparent. I, About a month ago, we're part of a big m and a. And so
20. [Sales Rep]  Uh-huh.
21. [Prospect]  I'm actually not working at IproReveal, But I'm on payroll for another 30 days. They let a 160 of us go about a month ago.
22. [Sales Rep]  Oh.
23. [Prospect]  But the reason I'm still curious, I'm doing some Like, consulting work for one of my friends,
24. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
25. [Prospect]  and I know they're considering a dialer. And, plus, Interviews that I'm having is they're wanting me to come in and be a SDR or a BDR leader. They're wanting to know what tech stack I'm using, thing, and so I usually give them examples of concert forum.
26. [Sales Rep]  Right. Yeah.
27. [Prospect]  So it's nothing I I can't do anything or or look at a demo now, but for sure, Send me an email. Do you have my Gmail?
28. [Sales Rep]  I don't have your Gmail. I guess one thing I would love to share with you is just that, Yeah. We obviously we are going up against Orem almost all the time. I think every deal that we see see is, is a competitive deal with Orem. And At least when we are able to get that buy in and have a head to head trial where the reps are actually using both Orem And Nook's at the same time.
29. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah.
30. [Sales Rep]  70% of the time, we're winning that business. I was just speaking to someone that that used Orem this morning for, they had used them for 2 years, and they just turned in June from Orem, came over to Nook. And the overwhelming response was just that, you know, our our system is more user friendly for SDRs. They love the UI. They actually love getting to cold calling it. It's less clunky. So yeah. I mean, I would I would love the opportunity as well to, To at least be a name on your mind, maybe when you are looking into or or having these conversations with folks you're consulting for and they they might want to see another
31. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm thinking too. Okay. So my email is c wright 61 dot a w. It's my personal email. They turned off my business email, so that's all I have right
32. [Sales Rep]  You said c?
33. [Prospect]  So c so it's cwright.aw@gmail.com.
34. [Sales Rep]  Rights.aw@gmail.com.
35. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah. I won't be able to do anything with y'all at this moment, but when I land,
36. [Sales Rep]  Awesome.
37. [Prospect]  I'm sure I'm gonna be, you know, stirring up some some demos and stuff like that when I build my tech stack for whatever company I land with and whatever new team I have to kinda build out. So
38. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. I hope you find something quick and, Then let just let me ask you, I mean, what would be, at this stage with you probably focused on so many other things and Landing that new job. I mean, what would be helpful to see in that email for you right now?
39. [Prospect]  Well, it's too early for pricing, and I understand the model, especially if you're like, Orem. I guess, probably your connectors. So what CRMs do you connect with would be helpful?
40. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah.
41. [Prospect]  And I'm I'm guessing you're probably on a monthly models. So but I could probably get that from your website. I'm sure. Do you have pricing on your website? Let me see.
42. [Sales Rep]  We don't have pricing on the website. I can I can shoot a quick blurb on how How pricing works? Even though it's not on the website, it's not like a shrouded mystery. It's a flat rate, same price for just about everybody.
43. [Prospect]  Oh, okay. So like the cornerstone, the connect, and the catalyst packages? Yeah. Yeah. That'd be helpful too to give me at least a ballpark of what those
44. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
45. [Prospect]  pricing options are for those 3 packages that you offer.
46. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I I think you'll be, I think you'll be very pleased if you're If you're used to seeing what Orum has been charging in the past. But, yeah, I can get that over to you.
