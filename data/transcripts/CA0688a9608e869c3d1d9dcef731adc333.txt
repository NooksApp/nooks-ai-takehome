1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Paul. How's it going?
3. [Prospect]  It's going.
4. [Sales Rep]  Hey. So, obviously, this is totally a cold call. You have 30 seconds for me to give you the reason why I'm calling you. And if you you hate it, you can feel free to hang up on me. Does that sound like a Pretty good deal.
5. [Prospect]  Sure. I can give you 30 seconds.
6. [Sales Rep]  Cool. So I was doing some research on Brightly, and it it just looks like you guys invested in a in a outbound team and, you know, we're helping a lot of companies just to cut to the chase, like, increase the amount of conversations they're having every day On the phone. So, for example, I'm an AE over here. I jumped into Nook's, and I got connected with someone within, like, 5 seconds. And it's really just helping us helping us and our customers have more conversations on the phone. Is calling a pretty big piece of your guys' pipeline generation strategy, or does your guys' world kinda look like?
7. [Prospect]  No. I mean, yeah, it's 90%.
8. [Sales Rep]  90% focused on cold calling.
9. [Prospect]  Yeah.
10. [Sales Rep]  Have you guys evaluated parallel dialers before?
11. [Prospect]  Not extensively. No. I mean, they've We've had high level conversations about it, but nothing actual no actual conversations of substance.
12. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. What, why is that? Is there a reason why, you know, those conversations didn't get taken to the next level for you guys?
13. [Prospect]  I don't know. I mean, timing was a big part of it. The the acquisition with Siemens was a big part of it. I mean, all all those things kinda kinda went into it.
14. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Got it. Well, I'm I'm actually curious for the Parallel dialing is 1 piece of this, but one of the real, like, claims to fame for Noakes is our virtual sales floor. And before giving you the pitch on that, can you kinda help me understand? Like, Is your team in office? Are they remote? Is it kind of a hybrid situation? I know it's
15. [Prospect]  Mhmm. Yeah. It's hybrid.
16. [Sales Rep]  large spectrum that stuff. Hybrid?
17. [Prospect]  Yeah. We're we're in the office 3 days a week, at home, twice a week.
18. [Sales Rep]  So how do you guys manage just, like, daily activities getting with each other, Doing call blitzes. Like, how are you guys doing that today? Is that just, like, out of Zoom and here and there, or what does that, what does that typically look like?
19. [Prospect]  I mean, when we're in office, it's just, it's it's a calendar invite, and we all just, like, sit down and do it. Right? When we're when we're at, when we're at home, it's, I mean, it's it's a challenge. I mean, it's looking at live call studio and SalesLoft, Looking at reports, seeing what who's doing what, thing things of that nature.
20. [Sales Rep]  Well, I really think this might be cool to look at then, Paul. Like, Because, really, like, what what Nux is doing is we're a we're a virtual sales floor that's built for
21. [Prospect]  Mhmm.
22. [Sales Rep]  Cold calling. Almost like in office Teams' booth on too because it just injects so much energy. And even when you're in the same room, you're not really intimately next each other and it kind of creates that environment, and it's really easy to operate. Your team can pop in and out. And then on the other side, we have that parallel dialer running, which Works in a lot of different use cases. Right? But really it's just automating all the manual stuff. So your team is
23. [Prospect]  Mhmm. Yeah.
24. [Sales Rep]  making more calls, getting more connects, at the end of the day, really having fun while doing it. So, I mean, you can correct me if I'm wrong. It it sounds like this might be worth looking at. Like, I'll I'll keep my,
25. [Prospect]  Mhmm.
26. [Sales Rep]  You know what? I'll keep the expectation that, hey. Timing might not be perfect, but I'd love to kind of get your feedback and get your eyes on it if you're open to connecting for 30 minutes.
27. [Prospect]  Yeah. I'm I'm not strictly allowed to take demos right now. Our, our and actually, like, yesterday, our our new Sales development director started. So it's it's a funky time for us. I personally can't do it. I'm going out on paternity leave sometime over the next 2 weeks.
28. [Sales Rep]  Oh, congratulations, man.
29. [Prospect]  So thank you. Thank you. So so I can't personally take this on right now. But have you have you heard of a a software called CallBlitz? Yeah. So, I mean, it it sounds a little bit like What what you kinda pitched there at the end with Nook. It's basically like a a virtual room. Right? And you're you it looks like a Zoom, but it's not a the call. You're all in there. You can see each other, and then you can, do 1 for 1 calling. Or you can do, like, an actual call blitz, all from from this little video conferencing thing. And you can see how many how many calls each person's made, how many positive calls they've made, things like that. Is that
30. [Sales Rep]  Yep.
31. [Prospect]  somewhat similar to what you're pitching?
32. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I mean, you know, it is a space where we have competitors. Right? Like, if, you know, if you were to evaluate Nook, you'd probably go and evaluate a couple other technologies. That's you know, that's how you guys are gonna make decisions. But,
33. [Prospect]  Yeah. Mhmm.
34. [Sales Rep]  we're typically we were just built for this, and we're We're we're we're really moving on market right now and having a lot of success. So
35. [Prospect]  Sure.
36. [Sales Rep]  I, you know, we have a free trial too. I would love to get your team in. Really easy to set up, and I I think that's kinda more down the road. Like, let's actually lay the foundation for this conversation looks like. But you said you're going on On paternity in 2 weeks. I'm not sure what your schedule looks like. Like
37. [Prospect]  Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well, rough roughly roughly 2 weeks. I I really don't know. Right? It depends on it depends on when my wife looks at me and says, alright. It's happening. Well, let's go.
38. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Oh, you're wasting my call today. That's cool, man. Well, I mean, I'm more than happy to kind of shoot my shot at other places in the organization. It sounds like your new director of sales development is kind of where I I should go next. But is there any way I could, like,
39. [Prospect]  Yeah.
40. [Sales Rep]  There's only one way for me to have that context. And I I get that you're not taking demos, and I wouldn't ask you to, like, launch a trial yourself, but I would love to just get your feedback in the context of Brightly. Like, In in the next 2 weeks, like, do you have any openings on your calendar we can look through this? Because I I really think based on what you talked about, you think it's
41. [Prospect]  Yeah.
42. [Sales Rep]  pretty cool and be like, Woah. And at the very least, you could tell me, Patrick, you guys need to do this, this, and this to compete for for Brightly's business
43. [Prospect]  Yeah. I can I can probably find some some time on Monday? I'm Hold on one second.
44. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. Sure. I know you're in you're North Carolina. Right? So
45. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah. I could do, like, 4 o'clock my time on Monday.
46. [Sales Rep]  Work like your time. That's one more time. Yeah. Let's, let's do it. I'll get that set up. And like I said, we'll we'll keep it pretty informal,
47. [Prospect]  Okay.
48. [Sales Rep]  but really excited to get your eyes on this and get some feedback. But, great talking to you today, man. Congrats again on the the soon to be new addition to the family, and we'll, we'll chat Monday.
