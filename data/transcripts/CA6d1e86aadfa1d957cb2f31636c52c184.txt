2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Lauren. This is Shar Davoody with Nooks. Good afternoon.
3. [Prospect]  Oh, hi. How can I help you?
4. [Sales Rep]  Hey. The the thanks for answering first off. Yeah. I was reaching out to you specifically because I saw the director of sales development, and I was curious if If your reps are hitting the phones like I am today.
5. [Prospect]  Not especially. No. In our market, phones are, like, the 3rd best way to reach our target audience.
6. [Sales Rep]  Holy crap. That means emails are amazing. What other platform are you guys using? Like, in our industry, I should say. Yeah.
7. [Prospect]  Sorry?
8. [Sales Rep]  What what's another way that you guys are getting it? So email is 1, I assume. Right? It's like marketing events or
9. [Prospect]  We get a tenant inbound. We're open source and used by tens of millions of developers across across the world. So we're still very lucky to have
10. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
11. [Prospect]  A small percentage, but a large volume
12. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
13. [Prospect]  of those developers reaching out directly to our team.
14. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha.
15. [Prospect]  Email prospecting is The best way that we, proactively reach our market,
16. [Sales Rep]  Mhmm.
17. [Prospect]  LinkedIn has been A very surprising, but incredibly effective way to reach our market. And then phones, we only use them in a very small part frequently. Like, 2, 3 times a month, we'll do a short call blitz to people who voluntarily gave us their phone number.
18. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah.
19. [Prospect]  But we don't use third party data, and we don't do any organized calling outside of that.
20. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. Gotcha. Well, yeah, it sounds like you guys got the inbound thing locked in. So that that's amazing. Yeah. What I was calling the intro is is a Is a is a company called Nook's. We're like a virtual sales floor, but primarily for calling. And I have seen inbound teams use it, but it's, You know, obviously, inbound, they raise their hand, they put their phone number. Usually, you get them super early, but it's for the ones that maybe, you know, 3rd, 4th, 5th time, 6th time you're calling them, and then they just kinda end up ghosting you. But, Yeah. I'm not too sure if what I'm saying resonates at all because it sounds like calling is not Not a
21. [Prospect]  Yeah. And I don't imagine that will change. Like, we sell to developers,
22. [Sales Rep]  big focus here.
23. [Prospect]  and oftentimes, like, user operator personas of developers, not even, like, people that, you know, would be considered an economic buyer. And so
24. [Sales Rep]  Mhmm.
25. [Prospect]  These people are not used to being called, and, you know, they'll they'll go to Twitter and they will at our board and
26. [Sales Rep]  What the heck?
27. [Prospect]  Oh, they will. Yeah. I've been in OpenSearch for 10 years. Developers do not like being called. And so, Yeah. And, they'll start Reddit threads that'll run for months,
28. [Sales Rep]  Oh,
29. [Prospect]  you know, just this mean, like, all the companies who cold call them. And
30. [Sales Rep]  no.
31. [Prospect]  Yeah. So it's a very different industry than, say, like, your outreach or Salesforce part of the tech market.
32. [Sales Rep]  Yep. Yep.
33. [Prospect]  You know, we're the deep end of the pool. So. And we did
34. [Sales Rep]  Alright. Fair enough. Well, hey, I I appreciate you giving me some context here. I'll remove you from the list, so it sounds like this doesn't apply. And then, if anything, is it okay if I shoot you a connect on LinkedIn? Perhaps in the future, things might change. You never know.
35. [Prospect]  Yeah. If you want a job with us calling, you can reach out to me.
36. [Sales Rep]  Yep.
37. [Prospect]  Yeah.
