1. [Prospect]  Hi. This is Mike.
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Michael. It's, Patrick calling from over at Nook's. And, hey, I this is totally a cold call, and I'd love to give my 30 seconds reason of why I'm calling. And if you if it's totally relevant, you can feel free to hang up with me. Does that sound like a a good deal?
3. [Prospect]  Well, I'll tell you what. I'll give you the 30 seconds.
4. [Sales Rep]  Sounds good. Thanks so much, Mike. So, basically, I was doing some research on rate and see, and it it looks like you guys have invested in a a BDR team. And, like, basically, what we're helping teams do is we have 2 basic offerings. Like, it's all on a platform, and we have a virtual sales floor where we can really inject a lot of energy into your team's cold calling sessions. So so there's a lot of collaboration, there's a lot of energy, there's enablement offerings, and it's really cool. And in the background of that, our parallel dialer is essentially helping teams get 3 to 5 x connects, or 3 to 5 x conversations per session, really, per day. It's it's pretty crazy. Like, I love it as an AE over here, but let me take a step back. Is cold calling a big piece of your guys' prospecting motion, or or can you kinda give me a feel of what you guys are focused on over there?
5. [Prospect]  Yeah. It is certainly. Lot of cold calling and emailing. I'll tell you what, I I Don't have a lot of time to talk with you at the moment. Can you send me just some information? Do you have like a, some type of, like, a video clip or something I could take a look at. That just gives me an idea of kind of what's going on.
6. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. A 100%. Is there is there any, like, thing in particular you're looking for outside of a video clip that you know, things that you're focused on might be a big priority for you.
7. [Prospect]  No. I mean, I'm I'm I'm I'm not. And and I'm I'm I'm not looking for anything necessarily, and I'm not necessarily the buyer here. But if it's something that looks like it makes sense, then, you know, I'd be happy to share it along. You know, there are a lot of solutions out there. I know that folks in my business are looking at different ones. And, I'm not sure necessarily where we're at on on those. But, you know, I I'd be happy to kinda take a look and pass it along. And if it if makes sense. We get back to you.
8. [Sales Rep]  I yeah. Absolutely, Mike. I'll tell you what. I can definitely send over an email with, with the video. But if you're gonna already watch a a 5 minute video, would you be open to take in like, I will not take more than 15 minutes, and we can schedule later on in the week. I'd love to walk you through the platform so you could ask some have some questions live. It's really easy, really easy to show, really easy to explain. But, typically, those conversations are a lot easier, and it's always, you know, more fun to have a human on the other end of that. Do you have 15 minutes from me later this week? And we can keep that expectations that maybe it might not move forward
9. [Prospect]  Yeah.
10. [Sales Rep]  just just to just to
11. [Prospect]  I I just did not the I'm just not the I'm just not the decision maker on this. So I'm gonna hold off for now until so I can take a look at it. I I'm not saying I I won't necessarily do that, but let me at least kinda try and take a look at at what you got first.
12. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what, I'll I'll create that video and send it over to you and I'll attached a case study as well, just so you could take a look at it. Do you own the the SDRs? How many people are on your team so I can get a better understanding of kind of where you fit into the
13. [Prospect]  We don't have a ton. I mean, we have 3 SDRs basically covering North America
14. [Sales Rep]  I.
15. [Prospect]  Right now, and a few in Europe. And those are even kinda further out of my purview. So, I mean, it just is They tend to be kind of managed over by our European teams. So, yeah, I hesitate to even kind of mention them. Because if they're down the road, I'm looking at something. They're down the road, I'm looking at something. And, anyways, but yeah. We're not a huge team. You know, we focus, I think, primarily
16. [Sales Rep]  I
17. [Prospect]  on, You know, trying to get into a relatively small number of large and high value accounts. And, We might have room to grow. But I don't know of any plans necessarily to grow the teams at the moment. So,
18. [Sales Rep]  yeah. Absolutely.
19. [Prospect]  Yeah. And that's one of these things that runs we run into a lot too. I think a lot of these these, you know, license based things maybe kind of primarily fit for bigger teams. I don't I don't know for sure if that makes sense for yours. Anyways, I've gotta go. Do you have my email address?
20. [Sales Rep]  Is it michael.bliss@radancy.com or should I make a note?
21. [Prospect]  Yeah. It's the 1. Yep. Yeah.
22. [Sales Rep]  That's it. Cool. Well, I'll send you the email. Once again, Mike, for your time. I'll let you
23. [Prospect]  Great. Alright.
