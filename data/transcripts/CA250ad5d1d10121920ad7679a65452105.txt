1. [Prospect]  Hello. LeanIX. This is Eric.
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Eric. Cameron over at Nook. How's your day going? Good. Awesome. I had you as a head of biz dev at LeanIX. I I was simply curious to start here if the if the reps that you're leading, if they're doing outbound calls that, outbound calls as well to, to hit their pipeline targets.
3. [Prospect]  Yes. We are.
4. [Sales Rep]  Awesome. Awesome. Is that, like, a team wide thing or do you have, You know, your reps that, you know, hit their target over email and email and social or is that, you know, pretty pretty unanimous across the team? Fifty calls a day. Wow. You got there quick. I don't think I've ever had that happen.
5. [Prospect]  So AI dialer, 5 times more connects. We use SalesLoft. Is that like you just, like,
6. [Sales Rep]  Yep. That that's how I'm using it right now. So yeah. Yeah. Pulls in sequence tasks from your SAP. In your case, it would be SalesLoft. I'm using software right now. Kind of that you know, most Perhaps if they're making 50 calls, most of that time spent is gonna be listening to the ringtone or logging no answer tasks. So our, you know, our software handles all of that with AI. In about a 3rd to a 5th of the time is just gonna connect you to, you know, all your live convos who are ready to ready to have a conversation. Cuts out a ton of manual work, and, you know, teams do either 1 or 2 things. They, you know, have have the bandwidth to approach more of their TAM quicker, Or, you know, just just frankly keeps, keeps confidence up in those call blocks, keeps your reps engaged, and gives them more time to spend on those emails and social.
7. [Prospect]  What I'm blanking on the I'm blanking on the vendor. Oh, what's the difference between you guys and Orem? Are you guys cheaper than Orum?
8. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I'd say I'd say we're certainly cheaper. Let me take a step back here, though. Is your is your Kim in office every day of the week.
9. [Prospect]  Not really. I mean, we've kind of embraced, the connected remote. Like we're kind of all over the place. Probably like 30%
10. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yep.
11. [Prospect]  of our reps are like in the office on any given day.
12. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. So that's that's gonna be a huge difference maker between us and Aurum. Why a lot of kinda, you You know, teams that are spread around the globe are using us as because of our sales floor. Kind of unfilowed reps out of making those calls alone in their kitchens and bedrooms, brings them together where they can live listen to other people's calls, do peer to peer coaching, and work together in a space that's, like, Built for calling together without the headaches of doing it in Zoom. So I I'd say that's a huge driver for teams that are in your situation. I I mean, high end base pricing, what you're gonna Gonna see is 300 per month per rep. But but that's state price and, you know, lots and lots of levers we can bolt. Awesome. Let's do it. I've got my calendar up. Well, eric.taylor@leanix.net.
