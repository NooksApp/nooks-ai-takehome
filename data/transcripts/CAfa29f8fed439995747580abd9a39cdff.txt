1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Chris.
3. [Prospect]  Hello?
4. [Sales Rep]  Skyler with Nook's. Do you have 30 seconds real quick by any chance?
5. [Prospect]  Say it again. You got cut off.
6. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Sorry. Skyler with NUCs. Was just hoping for 30 seconds real quick.
7. [Prospect]  From Nook's okay.
8. [Sales Rep]  Yeah, I appreciate it. Saw you were director of biz dev, actually at Variable. Was curious if you have reps, like, making cold calls but Just struggling to get enough connections and convos over the phone.
9. [Prospect]  Yeah. I mean, they so we do cold calls, but, like, are CEOs against, like, any outsourcing?
10. [Sales Rep]  Okay. So when when they cold call, we don't we don't outsource. Like, we're not an outsourced agency. Do they dial, like, 1 at a time right now with, like, a SEP platform?
11. [Prospect]  No. Like, everything is, like, in Florida, like, it's it's they just pick up their cell phones, but, like, we we can't like, what is it? A a platform that you guys have?
12. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. So essentially what NUCs does is instead of, like, calling 1 at a time and spending a lot of that Time listening to the phone ring. They can dial up to 5 lines at once. So if you're calling people with a low connect rate, Instead of spending all their time listening to the phone ring, they can have, like, 10 to 20 convos per hour.
13. [Prospect]  Yeah. I mean, with that, you you with so that all has to go through corporate on our end. You your best bet is to reach out To because we can't make that decision at local level. It needs to get approved by corporate and then however they wanna di like, if they wanted you to say Connect with the Miami team, Tampa team, Jacksonville team, and and, you know, start it, then it is what it is. But you you might you're probably Your best bet, I think, would be to reach out to Savannah, like, like Savannah, Georgia, and then her last name is Stone.
14. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Gotcha. Yeah. That's super helpful. I appreciate it.
15. [Prospect]  Yeah. So anything like that I mean, let's say if it if it does, like, proceed, right, and And our corporate team is, like, yeah, go for it. Then I think what would happen is you would start connecting with everyone at a local level. So, you know, either the GM director for each market, and then Show them, like, how, like, the platform will work and and showcase it.
16. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Gotcha.
17. [Prospect]  Yeah.
18. [Sales Rep]  Hey. I appreciate that, Chris.
19. [Prospect]  No problem. Yeah. Her so her email I'm not sure if you have emails, but her email is s stone and then at variableops.com.
