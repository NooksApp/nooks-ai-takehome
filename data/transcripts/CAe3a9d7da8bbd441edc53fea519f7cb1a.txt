1. [Prospect]  This is Kyle.
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Kyle. Skyler with Nook's. I know it's probably towards, like, the end of your Friday, and you're trying to head out soon. Saw you're a director of biz dev at Cigna Health. I was just curious if you got reps, like, making cold calls by any chance.
3. [Prospect]  Do I have run second cold calls?
4. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Some teams just, inbound only these days. You know? Sounds nice. Was just curious if you guys are still outbounding.
5. [Prospect]  We're outbounding, but I'm not in any position to make any calls, as far as utilizing outside resources and whatnot. But you're right. It is the end of my day. I appreciate the call. And,
6. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. No worries.
7. [Prospect]  I just it's just probably not it's definitely not the best, I'm not the best person for you to chat with.
8. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. And I get that. You know? And the market's like shit as well. It's hard to look at new tools. Do you think they'd be opposed to looking at new tools? Because, like, I guess, are you guys, like, not hitting your pipeline gen goals, or do you need, like, a higher conversion rate on the on the deal side?
9. [Prospect]  There's just there's not a lot of opportunity out there anyways, man. So it's it's a conversation.
10. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. Even if we could, like yeah. So guess even if we could 3 to 5 x your outbound pipeline, it wouldn't be worth, like, a chat by any chance?
11. [Prospect]  3 to 5 what?
12. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. 3 to 5 x the the meetings booked over the phone. Like, I guess that wouldn't be worth the chat.
13. [Prospect]  I mean, I'd be I'd be shocked if if the output was different than, kind of what my SDR is already doing.
14. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I mean, I know again, you know, I'm I'm stealing more time than I asked for, but, are they right now when they dial, do they do that 1 at time or they do they have, like, a tool like a dialer by any chance?
15. [Prospect]  They I don't know how they do. Well, they no. They call 1 at a time. When they do call, typically, they're just thrown bringing them emails together. That I mean, some are dialed in. Some
16. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha.
17. [Prospect]  are kinda all over the place.
18. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. So, essentially, quick elevator pitch, and I I promise I'll let you go. But
19. [Prospect]  I just know. I mean, I dude, I appreciate it, man. Seriously. And all like I, this is what I do. I just, I'm just not, I don't want to waste your time.
20. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
21. [Prospect]  And there's probably some people out there that could use this, such as for me. I'm not in a position to set this up for my company. And I generally even if it were to help, I probably wouldn't even suggest it because it just you don't want to deal with Signet. You don't wanna deal with this company. So
22. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. No. I understand. So I guess it wouldn't be worth reaching out to, like, the the decision maker or anything.
23. [Prospect]  I don't know. No. Probably not. I mean, the the STRs that we have, the sales development reps, just to save you time, I'll I'll talk about this. But The sales development reps that we have, I mean, they they get paid salary, and they get paid bonuses based on, like, meetings and stuff. It's not really the best setup. But, I mean, I don't know. I don't I don't think they're in any rush to kind of remove those roles. If they were, I would say it's definitely worth the conversation, but I don't think they are, to be quite
24. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha.
25. [Prospect]  honest. And, other reps like me might have a different
26. [Sales Rep]  And to
27. [Prospect]  perspective. I doubt it, but, yeah.
28. [Sales Rep]  And just to clarify, we don't like you know, it might have sound like us pitching, like, outsource SDR ing. Essentially, they'd be able to dial, like, 5 lines at once. So instead of spending a lot of time listening to the phone ring, they could have, like, 10 to 20 conversations per hour. So it'd make them more productive. So then instead of, like, hiring SDR number 11, and seeing a 10% pipeline increase, they could see, like, a you know, they could increase the whole team's pipeline, if that makes sense.
29. [Prospect]  Yeah. That we don't have that many STRs on them. It's it's it's very minimal. It's to the point where they're,
30. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. So
31. [Prospect]  those SDRs are they're hungry. They're very hungry.
32. [Sales Rep]  That's good. Yeah.
33. [Prospect]  And it's not really, like, it's not a high production rate. I wish I wish I wasn't getting more meetings than they were, but it's just the nature of the beast. But they work for multiple BDs like myself. So it's kind of an odd situation. It's not the most efficient. But like I said, it's it's how this This this organization operates, so I can't really do much about it.
34. [Sales Rep]  Okay.
35. [Prospect]  I don't know, man. I I honestly I don't know. It's a it's conversation to have with I don't know. Maybe someone else. I don't I don't think so. They use a bunch of different things. They have a couple different, apps that they use that I think make it for a better situation. I forgot what the one is that they use. I forgot. Completely different than, like, Salesforce and stuff, but, yeah, I don't know, man. I I feel like your time would probably be better.
36. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. No worries. I mean, you sound like a nice guy. Like, I feel like you might be open to to chatting, but I don't know. Like, you you know, I don't know if it'd be I don't know if it'd be worth your time, and I don't know if there's enough there for you to, like, show up, if that makes sense.
37. [Prospect]  I don't think it's worth your time, man. Yeah. I think I think same thing vice versa. I don't wanna waste your time.
38. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. No worries. Hey. I hope you have a good weekend, man.
39. [Prospect]  You too. Take care, man.
