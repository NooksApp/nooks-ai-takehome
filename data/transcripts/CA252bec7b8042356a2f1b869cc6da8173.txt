1. [Sales Rep]  Hey,
2. [Prospect]  Hi. Is this Joe Reicher?
3. [Sales Rep]  Joseph?
4. [Prospect]  Yeah. This is Steve speaking.
5. [Sales Rep]  Yeah, Joseph. It's, it's Cameron over at Nook's. This is, totally frank. It's a cold call. Do you have 30 seconds to see if it makes sense to chat? Appreciate that. Hey, senior at Deltek. I was just curious, is your, is your team over at Deltek, how, how important to them is Cold calling for their own pipeline, Jen.
6. [Prospect]  Yeah. It's a it's a big piece of what we do.
7. [Sales Rep]  Awesome. Gotcha. In terms of, like, a system for that. How do your reps go about that today? Is that like an outreach or a sales loft or how are they making those calls?
8. [Prospect]  Yeah. Currently, we Primarily utilize SalesLoft as our dialer, cadence operator, all that stuff.
9. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, I guess so. I don't know how high volume we are with the calls, but, a few things that we're hearing from teams that are outbound cold calling is is number 1, connect rates are getting lower. It's taken more activity to drive the same results from the past. More phone calls. Another thing is that, you know, there can be a big activity gap in response to that between your best reps and others that Simply not all reps are putting in enough calls in today's environment to drive that pipe. And last but not least, it can be it can be difficult to adjust on and pivot with the team without listening to all those calls 1 by 1. Does any of that resonate with you? Or totally off track, Joseph.
10. [Prospect]  Sure. Yeah. I mean, Definitely agree. Connection rates have been been on, you know, on the lower side recently, and I was just, you know, thinking nature of Summertime and things. Actually, we are seeing a an uptick recently, which is good.
11. [Sales Rep]  Cool. Okay. I'll share with you what I do or or how I need to. I actually got ahold of you with our platform Nook. So, We we handle all of kind of the manual work of calling, and sifting through those contacts to get to a conversation. So instead of, you know, working out of Salesloft, we integrate directly with that. And our platform only connects reps to folks who answer the phone live Like yourself. So I've been dialing for half an hour. You're my 7th or my 8th conversation now as opposed to in the past where I might have spent, You know, all day to to get to those 7 or 8 conversations. Huge quality of life change for for a lot of reps that are manual dialing. And, Normally if we can, you know, take a team and three x their conversation rate, we can do some pretty good things with their, with their Pipeline creation as well as long as that message is on point. Does any of that sound like it might be relevant for the team right now? Worth worth taking a look?
12. [Prospect]  It's interesting. I think that I guess my question for you is I understand, and I've been in multiple different settings, right, where, you know, frankly, right now, you know, my teams are calling into a pretty select, pretty select range of of contacts. Right? You know, we're working with, you know, specific organizations and industries as well as, you know, pretty specific titles and personas within,
13. [Sales Rep]  Right.
14. [Prospect]  And so, you know, I guess my question for you is in a lower volume, space, You know, where, where does that still fit in? Because I can obviously see in a very high volume space. You know, if you're calling 100 plus people a day, I changed things. But what if you're calling 20?
15. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I mean, I, I, if, if your reps, if, if that's all, If they're making 20, and if your average rep is making 20 phone calls a day and that, You know, if that's enough to push the needle, if that's where you find success and where the team can can hit their targets you're not looking to increase that by any means. I don't know if it would be a perfect fit. Right? Yeah. I think, I think if it, if you're that low, low volume and you're not not looking to make a shift to, you know, to place more calls, it might not be Perfect
16. [Prospect]  Yeah. No. And and appreciate the call. Appreciate the information. I I do think that, you know, currently, nature of our teams, again, is it's we're really focused on very, very, Highly researched, highly, identified, personas and contacts, and, the volume is just on the lower side, you know, 20, 30, maybe 40, but still, you know, those calls below below 50 a day. So, I mean, it's interesting. More than happy to, To to look at, you know, any info or resource, things like that, of course, but, it does it does seem that, it does perfectly fit with, you know, kind of my Our current business approach.
17. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Alright. Well, Joseph, I'll, I'll shoot you a connect request on LinkedIn and I, yeah, appreciate you taking the call and picking it up today.
18. [Prospect]  No worries. You have a good rest of your day.
19. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. You too. Take care. Bye bye.
