1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Aidan. It's Patrick calling from over at Nook's. Happy, happy Friday. How's it going?
3. [Prospect]  I'm doing good. Where did you say you're calling from?
4. [Sales Rep]  I'm calling from a company called Nook. Have you ever heard of this perchance? Yeah. N double o k s. And if not, is totally a cold call. I'm happy to give you the 32nd pitch on why I'm calling you. I you know, I was doing some research on Park Place, so you can feel free to hang up on me if you feel it's irrelevant After I give a
5. [Prospect]  No. I'll be honest with you. I'll be on I promise I'll give you I'll give you your time. My headset is just not Working right now. Let me just double check and figure out why is that not working.
6. [Sales Rep]  pitch. Can you hear me now?
7. [Prospect]  Let me see. Let's give that a shot. Yeah. Going so wait. You said Nook, n double o k?
8. [Sales Rep]  N, double o, k s. Yep. Are you gonna pull up the website while you get the while you get the white glove cold Call
9. [Prospect]  Okay. Yeah. Sure. Go on.
10. [Sales Rep]  here.
11. [Prospect]  Give it to me. It's a it's a Friday afternoon. I got 7 minute or 3 minutes before I'm leaving. So
12. [Sales Rep]  Alright. Sounds good. It'll be the best 3 minutes wrap up of the week, I promise.
13. [Prospect]  I
14. [Sales Rep]  But no. So I'm I'm calling because I was doing
15. [Prospect]  told my wife. Alright. Let's go.
16. [Sales Rep]  I'm calling because, I was doing some research on Park Place, and it looks like you guys invest pretty heavily into your your SDR team. So I figured cold calling is probably a a pretty big part of you guys' pipeline generation strategy. And really what it boils down to, Aidan, is Well, I'm hoping, like, my customers get 3 x, 5 x conversations per day, but it's it's their team, they're in the platform, it's your SDRs That are just talking to more more prospects. And we actually have a virtual sales floor that's, that's making it fun and enjoyable. And so really quickly, though, let me think of let me just backtrack a little. Is cold calling an important piece of your pipeline generation strategy, or or what's your world look like?
17. [Prospect]  Yeah. So it's it's pretty so I I am a sales development manager, but I work, I work under sales enablement. So we're technically, currently, still a training department. That's my core focus. Just taking a look. So it's an AI daughter that helps Almost kind of bring in prequalified calls in a way.
18. [Sales Rep]  So the way you want to think about it is, Right now, your team is, you know do you guys have anything? Like, what do you guys use for dialing? Is it Outreach, SalesLoft? Are you guys in Salesforce? Like, what is what is cold calling look like for you guys.
19. [Prospect]  Yeah. So we we use Outreach for our outbound, but we're not using their dialer yet. We are still on Cisco Jabber.
20. [Sales Rep]  Got it. So,
21. [Prospect]  So so it's not the the actual dialing out is not automated?
22. [Sales Rep]  essentially yeah. So, essentially, what you would be able to do with Moocs is we Integrate directly with Outreach, and what you're going to be able to do is, your your team will be able to and really quickly before I even say this, you guys on the same office? Are you hybrid? Are you remote? What is the the culture like over there for your SDR organization?
23. [Prospect]  We're so in the US, we're in 3 offices. We also have a location in UK, Germany, and I think we have another 1 to 2 offices in in South America. I think 2 or 3 offices In, APAC.
24. [Sales Rep]  Got it. And you're on the enablement side. What do what do those teams typically look like? Are they Spread out in the office? Is everybody getting together in call rooms? Or how are you guys running, like, power hours and stuff?
25. [Prospect]  We we have like a ball pen. So just because people have different patches they're calling into. So we let them kinda set when their power hour is essentially. But they're we kinda have a deal open office Kind of concept.
26. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. Got it. So this is, like, how you should think about it, I guess, like, from an enablement Standpoint. Basically, your team can log in to the Nooks platform. It's actually a virtual it's a it's like a video conferencing tool, but it's built For sales teams to get together and collaborate and send gifts at each other and really be connected. And in the background, all they have to do is click Call my Outreach tasks, and that will call through and do all those manual steps and automate them for them. So they're really just hanging out with their team. And then once they're connected, just like we are right now, they're getting sent out into a telephone booth, but and then having the conversation And then put back into the sales room. But really, like, what it looks like is I log on, I'm with my team, I click a button, and in 5 seconds, I'm having a conversation with a prospect. And that's kind of like where we're helping out, is just expediting how many conversations your team is having on a daily basis and Putting them in a place. We're having fun. So is that making sense, Adam? I got I'm curious to get your feedback off that and where you think that might fit in for for your team over at Park Place.
27. [Prospect]  Yes. I I get it. It's actually it's actually a nice interesting idea. I can definitely see This would have been definitely something we would have been super interested back when we were full remote in 2020.
28. [Sales Rep]  Yep.
29. [Prospect]  We we were a bit more aggressive in getting back people back into the office. I know how we all feel about that. Obviously, you you see the benefit of having people together. Our c CEO's choice on that was, hey. Let's do it physically rather than virtually. That being said, say for instance, something we will sometimes do, I'll I'll do with my trainee reps and, honestly, even our sales managers will do with their reps is, hey, We're gonna dial together. I'm gonna sit with you while you're dialing the phone. Do you have any, I guess, implementations that work with that so I could Be with them, it's them and I in a room, and I can hear when when they're calling. I can hear their calls kind of live or no. Yeah. Live would be better.
30. [Sales Rep]  Yep. Yeah. No. That's exactly what's happening. And, actually, we have a lot of teams In office using that because, just like you said, like, you can have 15 reps on the sales floor and then the manager's there, but there's no real way to say, Oh, this person's on the phone. Let me listen in. Right? There's no real way to do that, and that's kind of what the technology is enabling. So we have a lot of in office teams using the platform in the exact way that you're you're talking about.
31. [Prospect]  Yep.
32. [Sales Rep]  So I'm curious, Aiden, like, I'm sure this, you know, Park Place seems like a, you know, pretty large organization. I'm sure you guys have a bunch of people that make these decisions. But I'd love to, like, if you're open to a good 30 minutes and, like, put it in front of you and get your feedback and learn a little bit more about your organization, sounds like a good plan?
33. [Prospect]  Yeah. I I'm definitely not directly involved In anything like that, not gonna be a decision maker. But definitely interested, you know, if if this is something that kind of makes more sense, I can point it in the right direction. But also, If you're talking to someone that their their title says something higher than manager, then they're gonna be a better better direction to go. But, yeah, absolutely happy to hop on a on a 30 minute conversation with
34. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. What is your what does your calendar look like, next week? My Wednesday is looking Fairly open if that aligns with you. My Wednesday morning, I think
35. [Prospect]  Yeah. Wednesday is gonna be pretty free pretty free for me. I'm Eastern time zone. And this next Wednesday for me.
36. [Sales Rep]  Sure. Maybe 1 or I can even do 11, if that's easier. Your time? Is that are you talking East Coast? Because I'm over here on, I'm in California.
37. [Prospect]  Oh, gotcha. Yeah. So we do 11 east coast time then.
38. [Sales Rep]  11 East Coast time. Yeah. Let's do it. I will, I'll get that set up. And, hey, great talking to you, Aidan. Always fun to talk to somebody before they head out of the office, So, I'm looking forward to talking to you next week. And, yeah, enjoy your weekend.
39. [Prospect]  Awesome. Have a good one.
