1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Eric, it's Patrick calling from notes. How's your, how's your Wednesday going?
3. [Prospect]  I'm sorry, from
4. [Sales Rep]  I'm calling from a company called NookS, n o o k s. Any chance you ever heard of us?
5. [Prospect]  where? No.
6. [Sales Rep]  Cool. Well, I I'd love to tell you in 26 seconds why I'm calling you. And if you think it's totally irrelevant, you could feel free to hang up. Although, I have a pretty good idea of what you guys are doing over there. I've actually worked with Derek Rust in the past before. So, didn't get him today, but I figured I'd keep keep giving my shooting my shot. You know?
7. [Prospect]  K. You you got my attention.
8. [Sales Rep]  Cool. So, really, what we're helping teams do and I I know there's a really big SDR motion at Service Express? And what we would help your team do is increase the call activity that they can do, increase the amount of connect? They're getting increased conversations and at bats for the team. But not just that. We have a really awesome AI component
9. [Prospect]  Have a good night, Cody.
10. [Sales Rep]  that actually helps, like, collect what's happening on those calls so that we can surface that data to your enablement team, and we can help increase conversion of those FSs. And then all in all, like, at the same time, we have a virtual sales floor that basically makes it really fun to get into cold calling sessions and call places. So wanna take a step back.
11. [Prospect]  Mhmm.
12. [Sales Rep]  You know, is cold calling still a big piece of your guys' pipeline generation strategy? Or or what's going on in your world, man?
13. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. We we don't believe that cold calling is dead. Not yet. So we do, a good amount of outbound cold calling. Who are like would like do you have, like, a power dialer? Is that per like, what you guys Have a kind of like one off? Or what is your
14. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. So we have a parallel dialer that can essentially call, like like,
15. [Prospect]  what's your pipe
16. [Sales Rep]  five numbers at once? And then, like, if somebody were to answer, we can hang up the rest of those numbers, collect them on a list for your team, and then can give them a callback at the end. But, really, yeah, we're just, like, maximizing your team's chance of getting a person on the line. For for example, like, I'm with my team right now,
17. [Prospect]  Sure. Sure. Sure.
18. [Sales Rep]  and I clicked dial, and it's called through a list of a 100 people. And in about 5 minutes, I've made I've made, 20 calls, got 3 people on the line. It's it's pretty it's pretty cool stuff actually. And all that like, it it just helps the ref focus on being present and have fun while cold calling you. We all know it can be pretty daunting. You know?
19. [Prospect]  Yep. Yeah. Yeah. I think, like, our team does a good job getting the dials out. I'm interested in increasing connect rates.
20. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
21. [Prospect]  That is a, I think, a major need for our team. So I guess, like Tell me about that.
22. [Sales Rep]  Yes. So you can do a couple things there. We actually we have filters that support? The people that are most likely to answer, we can filter things like mobile numbers and actually surface some reporting that helps you understand when you can call and what you can do to increase connect rates? Another side of that is we actually have enrichment that helps you get mobile phones that might be missing or wrong, and plug some of that stuff in, which I know is on the newer side, but, you know what? I I think it's it's an important piece of increasing connect rates and getting more mobile numbers? Right? So that's a that's another piece of it.
23. [Prospect]  Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.
24. [Sales Rep]  Yeah, there's a couple of levers we've been pulling.
25. [Prospect]  Okay.
26. [Sales Rep]  Happy to talk through this, but, Eric, I mean, it sounds like it you know, this is something that's worth taking a look at? At least that's what I'm hearing on my end. Tell me if I'm if I'm totally wrong.
27. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. I mean, depends on your conversation with Derek. I work with him directly. So, You know, if that's something that he's already vetted out, then I would prefer not to, use my time. Not that it'd be a waste, but, like, use my time in that way.
28. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
29. [Prospect]  So I guess where did your last conversation end with Derek?
30. [Sales Rep]  Notes? So let me clear that up, actually. I I used to work at a company called LeadIQ, and me and Derek worked really closely over there and have a really good relationship. Actually, I think if, if we got some time and through him on the calendar, I think it it might bring a smile to his face because we've known each other for a while. I just gave him a call today, wasn't able to get him through, but, me and Derek
31. [Prospect]  Yeah.
32. [Sales Rep]  me and Derek
33. [Prospect]  Yeah. You wanna get Derek's attention, leave a voice mail.
34. [Sales Rep]  go a little ways
35. [Prospect]  And in fact, I was expecting a call
36. [Sales Rep]  back?
37. [Prospect]  from a unknown number today, so that's Honestly, you know the reason why I answered. But, yeah, that's, you wanna you wanna get his attention. Just leave him a voice mail. He'll They'll look at it, and then decide to respond.
38. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Sounds good. But, like, I guess the context I can take oh, go ahead, Eric.
39. [Prospect]  But I was just gonna say, like, why don't you send me over, send me a little bit over a little bit more info, something that I could, like, bite on for a little bit. I do not oh, man. Obviously, always time is a factor, but, potentially, next week, Wednesday in the morning. If you wanna try to send something over to me, you can. But I would like maybe some material ahead of time.
40. [Sales Rep]  Yeah, a 100%. I can send it over and, you know, it might even make sense because, again, like like, I've I've been meaning to reach out to Derek anyway. Like, do you mind if I pro him on the thread? And I like I promise it I don't I really don't think it'll piss him off, especially because talking to you, it sounds like this would be a cool priority. But I would love, you know, you're really close to your team on the front line to get your feedback and to have you a part of that conversation as well if you're if you're open to that. And I can kind of, like, just talk to you guys both in the same thread, send that information. And then maybe throw some times on and see if we can we can block down some time for next week. Is that a good plan?
41. [Prospect]  No. Not yet. I mean, don't throw Derek in yet. If I can insulate him a little bit, I will. But I will chat with him, and throw by him. I have a meeting with him tomorrow. So, if he wants to be added on that, then I will I will include him, but,
42. [Sales Rep]  Mhmm.
43. [Prospect]  most likely knowing him that he will say, cool. Like, Run with it, or, sure, I don't mind being involved, but I'll let him make that decision.
44. [Sales Rep]  Alright. Cool. Sounds good. Well, I'll send you over some more information. Did you say that tossing something on the calendar next Wednesday, early Wednesday, and and we'll see if it sticks as a placeholder? Or would that be okay? Or
45. [Prospect]  Yeah. That's, yeah, that's fine. And probably in the morning. I think that, well, I think the afternoon is Full. So
46. [Sales Rep]  cool. Yep. Can do? And I think you're you're based out of Michigan. Right? So central time?
47. [Prospect]  mhmm. Yep.
48. [Sales Rep]  Cool. Sounds good, man. Well, it was great chatting with you. Appreciate giving me some more context, and I'll send over this information. Looking forward to getting together next week.
49. [Prospect]  Perfect.
50. [Sales Rep]  Awesome. Cheers, Right.
