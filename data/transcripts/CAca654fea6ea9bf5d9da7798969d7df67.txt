4. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. It's Skyler with Nook. I'll be honest, man. I don't even know if this is relevant. I saw it looks like you work in in Sales, do do you guys do cold calls by any chance over at Borman Marketing?
5. [Prospect]  I am no longer a Borman right now. So
6. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Gotcha.
7. [Prospect]  They really don't they really don't do just so you know, as an organization, they're not a really big cost, outbound organization. They manage their they have too many clients they already manage already. So, I mean, they I mean, the business has been around since the seventies. So there's
