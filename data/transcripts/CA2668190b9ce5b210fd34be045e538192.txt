1. [Prospect]  This is Xiaobei.
2. [Sales Rep]  Hi, Shelby.
3. [Prospect]  Yes.
4. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Hey, Shelby. It's, Cameron Baker over at Nook's. Totally frank this is a a cold call. Do you have 30 seconds to hear me out, see if it makes sense to chat?
5. [Prospect]  Sure.
6. [Sales Rep]  Appreciate that a ton. I was just curious if If for your team, the America team at precisely, how important is cold calling to your own team's pipeline gen?
7. [Prospect]  Mixed reviews.
8. [Sales Rep]  Mixed reviews. So does that mean, like, some some SDRs, are more successful than others at it or are there just some SDRs that aren't even, you know, using that as a channel?
9. [Prospect]  We have a cold calling program set up, but not every member of our team participates in that Based on whether or not they are supporting inbound or outbound activities.
10. [Sales Rep]  I see. Okay. So, obviously, probably more so on the outbound team.
11. [Prospect]  Mhmm.
12. [Sales Rep]  I see. Okay. I'll share with you how I reach you. I I reach you with our platform. So for that team that has higher volume on the cold calling side. I'm sure you might have something in place like a sales loft or an outreach where they,
13. [Prospect]  Yep.
14. [Sales Rep]  they make calls out of, as opposed to, you know, making 50 to 75 dials in a day, having a few conversations while having to do the manual work for the reps that don't answer. Our platform only connects your reps, to folks that answer the phone like yourself. So they can typically have 3 to 5 times them on a live conversation they would have going through SalesLoft or Outreach while all those manual tasks are handled in the back end forum. So as an example, I've been dialing here for about half an hour through my 7th or 8th live conversation, which in the past might have been an impossible metric to hit, without it. But does that that sound like something that that might be relevant for the outbound team? Or
15. [Prospect]  I'm not sure. I to be honest, I don't really make the decisions around here when it comes That, my boss's boss does. I know right now we're working on condensing some of our vendors for some of the tools that we have because we're just not seeing the ROI with them.
16. [Sales Rep]  Yep.
17. [Prospect]  So, I don't know if this is a good time for us to have a conversation regarding a tool like this. Sounds similar to some other things that, we've heard integrate with Outreach, that's what we use for, our outbound and inbound lead management stuff. So I'm, I'm not really sure what to tell you, but, if you want to share some information to me via email, I could, park it in, you know, a folder and then save it for when we kind of get this condensing completed.
18. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Have you, you said it sounds like other tools. Have you maybe explored, like, an Orum or, like, a connect and sell in the past?
19. [Prospect]  I honestly cannot remember what it's called. Actually, when I was an SDR, I used the tool, when I was calling, for a different company when I was calling
20. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
21. [Prospect]  For real estate. So I can't remember exact exactly what it was called, and then I can't it's been too long, unfortunately, for me to remember.
22. [Sales Rep]  Okay. That that's perfectly okay. I'll, I'll shoot, an email over to you as a high level overview, to to add to your growing archive that is, is it shelby.fakura@precisely.com?
23. [Prospect]  Yes.
24. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Alright. Well, that sounds good. I'll have that over to you shortly, Shelby, and I, I appreciate you taking the call.
25. [Prospect]  Yeah. No problem.
26. [Sales Rep]  Alright.
