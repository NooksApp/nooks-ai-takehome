1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Sean. It's Patrick calling from, Nook. How's your how's your Tuesday going?
3. [Prospect]  Patrick from who?
4. [Sales Rep]  From Nook's. Have you ever heard of us? N o o k s.
5. [Prospect]  First time I'm hearing you.
6. [Sales Rep]  Cool. Well, I know I'm giving you a call out of the blue, and it's obviously a cold call. But do you have 30 seconds? I'll tell you exactly why I'm calling you, and, you can feel free to hang up on me if it sounds like Sounds like that's best interest. That's how you get the plan?
7. [Prospect]  Fire away.
8. [Sales Rep]  Cool. So I was doing some research on Anaplan, and I've actually worked you guys before, in my past life at at a company called LeadIQ. But, yeah, I know
9. [Prospect]  Yep.
10. [Sales Rep]  But, you know, your BDR team, outbound pipeline generation is a big focus over data plan. And if I you know, things are still the same, and I know cold calling was big piece of that pipeline generation strategy. And really what we're doing over here at Nook's is helping your BDRs have more conversations every day, like Three x conversations every day through technology like, first off, parallel dialer. Just automate all the manual stuff that your team is doing to maximize them actually speaking into prospects and not doing, you know, low value tasks? And on the other side, there's a virtual Salesforce component where we can really inject a lot of energy into cold calling, into team sessions? But wanna take a step back. Is that how things are today? Or, like, what is your world like? What are you guys focused on in the sales development side of things?
11. [Prospect]  In in terms of what? I mean, we we focus we focus on scheduling meetings
12. [Sales Rep]  Oh, yeah. So how big of How big of a role is cold calling play in, in that? Is that you know, what's what channels do you guys mainly focused on?
13. [Prospect]  And building It's part of it. I would say we do it's probably about 5050. 50% of our meetings are booked via email. 50 of them are being phoned. But Every sequence that we have, that we run, will have call, tasks, and emails. So it really just depends on which step they get them on. But they're both very much a focus for us.
14. [Sales Rep]  Got it. So, like, I I just kinda wanna paint a picture for you because, the the reason I joined this company was because I'm a big cold caller and believer in the phone. But, like, essentially, I was I was on with my team in our virtual sales floor. Right? We're chatting,
15. [Prospect]  Sure.
16. [Sales Rep]  and I click a button and in, you know, 10 to 15 seconds? I'm talking to a prospect. And that happens every time. So a quick button in 10 to 15 seconds. I'm actually having a conversation, which is I'm not gonna lie. Like, it's Sean, Lee, I'm an AE over here building my own pipeline, and it's, like, life changing. Instead of, like, having to go through and dial 1 by 1, I can really just focus on saying, hey. I'm calling Anaplan right now. I have this sorted by Anaplan. And then I, you know, get on the phone. I can really focus on the conversations I'm having with my prospects. So, you know, I'm curious, like, if we could, like, 3 x, 5 x the conversations your team is having every day, is Is that something worth looking at? Or or I wanna kinda get your sentiment on, like, how this is how this is falling on your side of things.
17. [Prospect]  Few things. Wonder how I mean, how are you guys different than Orem? Because it sounds like you I've I've saw a demo with Orem, and they're basically like a phone scaler. Or I mean
18. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
19. [Prospect]  yeah. How are you how do you guys differ from Orem?
20. [Sales Rep]  Well, before before chatting Or what was your kind of feedback there? Were you, like, hey. Like, this is this is freaking awesome, or was there some stuff that was falling shorter? What was kind of your impression there with them so I I know what I'm What I'm what you're going off of.
21. [Prospect]  It was cool. I mean, and again, I should have probably started this from the very jump, But we have no money to buy anything right now. I mean, we are we are taking away tools rather than Vine, if that makes sense right now. So we, we are not in any position from what I've been instructed to by anything. I would say the one thing that's top of mind, However, for myself, for the other leaders, my bosses, etcetera, is just integration with AI. Again, I would say we are less of a cold call shop. And, quite candidly, we've become way more Email message focused. And so I know that my my my leadership is focused on or is interested in AI. In whichever way that can help us, whether that's a phone scaler or whether that's a way to help create personalization at scale, that's what We're focused. That's what we're, as a company, I think, dialed in on.
22. [Sales Rep]  Got it. I I actually think this would be really interesting then because I think one of the the compelling components here is not just How we're helping on the parallel dialer component. Right? We're we're helping you guys get more connects. We're helping you guys have more conversations. But on the other side, we're using AI To essentially gather the notes from all those conversations, so there's not missing gaps and information in your guys' Is Outreach and your guys' Salesforce? All that stuff gets closed. And then on the reporting side, we're gathering a lot of stuff to help, like, Bring prescriptive insights. So instead of sitting here and saying, hey. We're gonna schedule a call block for Monday, Wednesday, Friday. We'll actually sit down and say, Hey. Based off your call metrics and your connect rates, the best times for you to be calling your personas is this, this, and this. On the other side, We also have a language component where we're tracking what's happening. You know, are people booking meetings? And if they are, did it come after 1 objection? Did it come after 2 objections? What were those objections? How is your team performing against those objections? So the things that, like,
23. [Prospect]  Yep.
24. [Sales Rep]  not high level metrics, but Really prescriptive stuff that's helping you guys with strategy. And then obviously on the other side, really scaling up efficiency. And and are you guys remote? Are you guys hybrid? Or what's What's work culture like for the SDR team at at Anaplan? I know you guys are pretty big, so probably a little scattered. Right?
25. [Prospect]  Ver, it's all remote.
26. [Sales Rep]  Got it. So how do you guys how do you guys do enablement? How do you guys get in, get in one place to make cold calls? Is that hopping on a on a Zoom meeting?
27. [Prospect]  Say that question say that question again for me.
28. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. How are you guys do you guys have, like, cobbletses? Or how are you guys calling together? Is it just hop on a Zoom meeting and Everybody's expected to call together. Is it, hey, everybody just kinda does their own thing and is calling from their bedroom, or or what does that look like?
29. [Prospect]  Little bit of both. I mean, we'll have scheduled call blitzes, and then a lot of the phoning is just done independently. And we do we do different competitions and so on and so forth. But
30. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I mean, do you feel like there's there's gaps there? Would you like your team to, like like how does that impact energy and morale for the team? Are they do you get the feeling that, hey. We would love to we would love to be together more and kind of, you know, get get more out of these cold calling sessions or especially on the enablement side. Like, how are your managers in and helping coach them on the fly and stuff.
31. [Prospect]  Outreach. Outreach.
32. [Sales Rep]  So going back and, like, listening to calls.
33. [Prospect]  Yeah. Going back listening to calls. But actually in outreach, you can listen to them live as well. So we will do pop in sessions like that within especially with newer reps. But listen, I'm happy to Take a look at, take a look at it. Again, just so you're aware, like, there's no way in
34. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
35. [Prospect]  there's no way that we're buying anything this year. And it might I mean, just to give you context. I don't want to waste your time. So, I'd be happy to look at it, take a little further look at it, but It's not even a near term or even probably midterm thing right now, but happy to look at it with you.
36. [Sales Rep]  A 100%. Yeah. We'd love to get in front of you, getting your feedback. And in the meantime, if your team's trying to build pipeline, like, We have a free trial with no commitment. So if we wanted to get that set up and just, like, have a have 2 weeks to a month where we're booking a ton of meetings just for free, totally, like, fully funded, we can even look at that option too in the meantime as you guys are, you know, tightening up on finances because I know a lot of a lot of organizations are doing that right now. So I mean, yeah. Do you have time On Thursday this week? Should we shoot for after the holidays? I know a lot of people are eager to get out of the office for a long weekend.
37. [Prospect]  Yeah. I have no time Thursday. It's the last day of the month for us, but I have time I have time Friday afternoon.
38. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Let's see. I think we're we're out on Friday.
