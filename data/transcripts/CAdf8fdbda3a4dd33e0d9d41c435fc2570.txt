1. [Prospect]  Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hi Sydney. This is Shar Davoody with Nook's. Good afternoon.
3. [Prospect]  Hi. How are you?
4. [Sales Rep]  Hey, I'm doing great. I realize this is a cold call, so you're obviously not expecting it, but I was curious if you had a quick 30 seconds for me.
5. [Prospect]  I tell people to cold call all day long, so I would be a real butthead if I hung up on you. So go ahead.
6. [Sales Rep]  Oh no. Alright, I appreciate that. Reaching out to you specifically, obviously I saw you, the Senior sales development manager there at Athena, and, really wanted to see if you guys have reps that are, you know, utilizing the phones and trying to generate some pipeline. Do you have reps that are calling today?
7. [Prospect]  Yes. My whole thing.
8. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha, gotcha. And like, is everything going great there, are they Connecting, are they doing amazing, or are they kind of, is that a big pain point for you guys right now? Yeah, like I guess the whole equation. The reason I'm asking that is because NUCs is essentially like a live conversation platform that Helps your reps get into more live conversations with your target prospects while improving the coaching, which is something that you can definitely do.
9. [Prospect]  Yeah. We've looked at platforms like this before, The objection I have not heard someone be able to handle yet is that my reps call medical practices. Right? And so, They reach a receptionist with a great deal of frequency. And so, Often, you know, they're reaching this receptionist and and almost always they reach a receptionist because it's a medical practice and they should answer. And as a result, our contact rate is not as a function of, like, getting a voice mail in the way it might be in other industries, but instead, it's just not reaching the person that we're hoping to reach. So I don't know that a piece of technology could solve that problem for us because of that Challenge. Does that make sense?
10. [Sales Rep]  Absolutely, yeah, what you're dialing, where you're dialing, they pick up, so it's not a problem of picking up, but it's getting routed to the correct person.
11. [Prospect]  Yes. Exactly. Yep.
12. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. Yeah, I mean, this is more of like, I guess the coaching aspect of it, of, you know, it seems like you're not dialing mobile direct numbers, so
13. [Prospect]  Mhmm. No.
14. [Sales Rep]  That part might not be there, but how are you guys coaching your reps today? I guess that would be my next question.
15. [Prospect]  Yep. So we use outreach right now. We just implemented it a couple of months ago. We love it.
16. [Sales Rep]  Nice.
17. [Prospect]  In order to record both sides of the calls, and then we use, the Chorus tool to, to do that coaching. And that is how we coach. So I I coach at minimum 3 calls per rep each week. You know, we do call recording sessions, all that kind of good stuff.
18. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah, I love it. So, that's actually fantastic that you do that, because most people have it, but they don't use it, so that's awesome.
19. [Prospect]  No point in paying for it if you're not gonna use it.
20. [Sales Rep]  Okay, trust me, right? We've seen we've seen worse out there. So basically how NUCs works is like, If you could imagine like a Zoom call, but I don't wanna call it a Zoom call because it's more of like a virtual sales floor. And Rather than doing that click to call 1 at a time, you know, you kind of log into our virtual sales floor, you can have that 1 on 1 session, you could dial in a group, when someone gets connected on a call, you could live listen to the call and give feedback right away. Sometimes, I used to be a sales manager before this, I would do like Friday call reviews, bring a good call, bring a bad call type of deal. And
21. [Prospect]  Mhmm. Yeah. Yep.
22. [Sales Rep]  I found that Maybe, like, that's great, but you know, the weekend comes around, they forget. This is more, a little bit more like now type of deal.
23. [Prospect]  Yep.
24. [Sales Rep]  But that's kind of our value prop, yeah.
25. [Prospect]  Yeah. I mean, I think that's great. I think, you know, to be honest with you, I don't I don't see us moving forward with something like that in the short term. But I think primarily because of the the issue around the receptionists. And and, You know, we we get together at a Teams meeting all the time and listen to each other on calls. We share the audio. I I don't see a real need for it is our organization right now and I wouldn't want to lead you on, but I do appreciate the call. You said you did a great pitch. I think you handled my objection effectively. So I'll give you some positive feedback there.
26. [Sales Rep]  There you go. It's my 2nd day on the job here. So I just sent you a I just sent you a LinkedIn request. Hopefully, we could connect, and I could follow your journey. So, awesome.
27. [Prospect]  Oh, you're doing great. Yeah. Sounds good. I'll talk to you later. I'm sure. So, I hope you have a great rest of your day.
28. [Sales Rep]  Alright, Sydney. Have a good one. Thanks.
