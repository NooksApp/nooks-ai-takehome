That sounds interesting, but I'm not sure how that fits into my life right now. I completely understand.

We believe it could open up a world of possibilities. It does sound fascinating, but I'm afraid I'm not in a position to consider such a purchase right now. I appreciate your honesty. We understand that this is a significant investment. However, I'd love to schedule a brief meeting with our product specialist to give you more insights and explore how the space car could align with your future aspirations. Would you be open to that? I appreciate the offer, Alex, but I'm going to have to decline for now. It's just not something I see in my immediate future. No problem at all, and I appreciate your time today. If your circumstances change or if you ever want to learn more about our space car, feel free to reach out. We're here to answer any questions you may have. Thanks again for considering it, And have a wonderful day. You too, Alex.
