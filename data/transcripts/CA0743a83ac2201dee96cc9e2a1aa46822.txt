1. [Sales Rep]  Garrett, hey. This is Josh with Nook's. Happy Friday to you.
2. [Prospect]  Hello? Hey. Who is this?
3. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. It's it's Josh with Nook's. I probably caught you mid coffee slipper driving there. Do you have 30 seconds? So, Gary, if I miss the mark, I'll just hang up on myself. Okay. I appreciate you, man. I so reason I was reaching out to you, specifically, Garrett, I know you're Managing a team. I'm sure you got a bunch of SDRs, BDRs making outbound cold calls. Is that is that a fair assumption?
4. [Prospect]  Correct.
5. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Good deal. Those pesky SDRs. I know cold calls are the worst, so I I appreciate you picking up, but, Garrett, you you tell me if I'm wrong here, man, but, I'm talking to our managers every day, and when it comes to cold calls to drive more piped in, getting people to actually pick up the phone Can be a challenge, and then it's the worst when your team spends a dial block just listening to the ringtone. So SQLs can be down and all that stuff. Are you are you bumping into any of that over there at field routes, or do you have
6. [Prospect]  I mean, you know, we have our challenges, of course. I mean, there's I don't think there's a single BDR or SDR organization that doesn't.
7. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
8. [Prospect]  But, I guess with I mean, to be honest, the only reason I listen to these calls is because of what I do. So, but
9. [Sales Rep]  You.
10. [Prospect]  yeah. I mean, why don't you just tell me, like, How you think you could help us? And then if I, I think it's worth looking into, then I'll I'll let you know.
11. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Totally. No. I'm correct me if I'm wrong. I was looking at you. Blake had a job posting from a few months back that's been taken down, but I was able to see the posting. It looks like you guys had a KPI of making about 70 many contacts between, like, emails and dials a day. Is that accurate?
12. [Prospect]  Yeah. That's that's pretty accurate.
13. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Good deal. And so Basically how Nook's helps SDR BDR teams like yours is so we we play nice with Outreach SalesLoft. You're able to integrate Tools in, and so now, like, when I'm when I'm calling folks like you, I'm in I'm in Nook's right now, and so I can call up to 5 people at a time. And so Basically what that means for me is if I have a 100 dials to go through, instead of that taking me an hour, hour and a half, 2 hours, I can get done in about 20 to 40 minutes depending on who's picking up, and so I'm just your reps get a lot more at bats quicker and then they're spending less time doing it, and so they're able to More meetings that way and just get more time back in the day. Something else that's kind of cool too is for coaching purposes is that you're it's all live. We're in a virtual you. You can actually listen to
14. [Prospect]  So
15. [Sales Rep]  to your reps calls live, give live coaching on the call, and feedback and all that. Does that, Garrett, does that sound even remotely interesting or have I totally missed the mark?
16. [Prospect]  I mean, I think so. What what is it let me ask you this. I've always kinda wondered this with these, you know, for the lack of a better term, auto dialers.
17. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah.
18. [Prospect]  How do you what happens if multiple people answer?
19. [Sales Rep]  That's a great question, and I used to go door to door and so I didn't want Multiple people answering the door at the same time. I had it happen once. What what happens with this man is it goes it literally goes down to the millisecond, And so it's not super common. It's not as common as you'd think, but when it does happen, for whoever picked up that split second Faster. The other person, it's just gonna show up as a dropped call, for the prospect, and then it's nice because once I'm done my calls, it actually shows me, if there was any of those that happened, like if there was any of those drop calls, and then it just gives me the nudge to change the number and give them a callback.
20. [Prospect]  Right, right.
21. [Sales Rep]  So
22. [Prospect]  Yeah. I mean, I I'd be open to looking into it.
23. [Sales Rep]  super. K.
24. [Prospect]  I mean, unfortunately, not today because it's it's already
25. [Sales Rep]  Cool. Yeah. No. No. I it's Friday, man. I'm,
26. [Prospect]  yeah.
27. [Sales Rep]  what what time zone?
28. [Prospect]  Why don't you, I'm in EST.
29. [Sales Rep]  Oh, you're you're ready to you're ready to leave
30. [Prospect]  Right. Right.

33. [Sales Rep]  Mhmm. K. Cool. Let's do that then. Let me,
34. [Prospect]  and then and then we can talk a little fur
35. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Do you are you open to because I'm happy to send you more information. I can send you, like, a 1 pager. Honestly, like, I don't want to I don't want to blast your inbox with a bunch of information. Would you be opposed if we were just, like, confined 25, 30 minutes when you're And we can just kind of show you the platform, and then from there what's actually pretty cool is that we do 2 free week trials. So if you think that it you know, if you want your team to take it for a test drive, see what it does for your SQLs and efficiency,
36. [Prospect]  Mhmm. Mhmm.
37. [Sales Rep]  you can do that. If you think it's lame, looks, Whatever. Then we don't have to. Does that sound fair if we were to find 25, 30 minutes?
38. [Prospect]  Yeah. I mean, it definitely does. And I, I appreciate your objection handling there. I think, Yeah. I I this is what I'll do, and and I'll be real with you because I do this for a living.
