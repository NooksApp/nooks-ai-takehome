1. [Prospect]  Hi. This is Jordan.
2. [Sales Rep]  Hi, Jordan. This is Daniel with Nooks. I'll be totally honest. This is a cold call. I'm just wondering if you'll hear me out for a few moments.
3. [Prospect]  Cool. Happy to hear you out. Not sure that I can offer you anything, but give it a shot. Let's go.
4. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Appreciate that. I'll be brief. So I'm calling you with Nook's, our platform. And it's doing 2 thing like 2 things right now are happening. 1 is that an AI was dialing for me for the past 30 minutes. Made it close to like a 100 ish calls. Haven't made a single one myself. And it detects pickups so that I can call multiple people at once and get more Actual connects just like this. Way more than I would than I'd get by 1 like 1 by 1 dialing. And then also what's happening is I'm inside of Nook's virtual sales floor with the rest of my go to market team.
5. [Prospect]  Sure.
6. [Sales Rep]  We're onboarding some new reps and they're listening live to how I'm carrying this cold call in real time. So that's that's overall what we do. I see that you're actually Atlanta based. I am too. I'm I'm based here in Lawrenceville, not not too far outside of the perimeter. But yeah. I mean, is is what I said relevant to you at all, do you think this would be something you'd want to take a closer look at, like for 15 minutes? We actually show it to you in action.
7. [Prospect]  So yes and no. Let me be honest with you. I'm actually in the midst of Hunting for my new gig, so I don't have a spot right now necessarily that I would know that this would be a good fit, but I'm always interested in new technology. Certainly, we wanna keep this on the radar as I settle into my, you know, my my new spot about some things on the horizon hoping, you know, to be landed within the month, so I'm happy to pick up this conversation maybe beginning of December. Is that you know, maybe maybe shoot me a LinkedIn message, Beginning of December, and let's see if it maybe makes sense to talk then based on where I'm at. I am curious How you differ from other dialing tools? I mean, I've I've used other, you know, other dialing tools where, you know, it's it's like a, you know, a 100 vials or whatever and takes the rep almost no time, so how do you differ from some of your competitors?
8. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. So which, which which tool are you used to using or have you used in the past?
9. [Prospect]  Oh god. I've tried, like, a 100 of them. You know what? Actually, Orem is one of the only ones that I haven't checked out. I was gonna check it out earlier in this year, and then we decided we wanted to go in a different I didn't even bother trialing it, but I did have a demo from them. They looked interesting. Connect something, media something, dial something. I mean, I know. But, you know, they're they're a dime
10. [Sales Rep]  I hear you. Yeah. So aside from just an AI powered dialing tool,
11. [Prospect]  a dozen.
12. [Sales Rep]  we're more broadly like a like an AI powered sales development platform. So it's basically 3 key pillars. 1 is the AI that makes dialing more efficient that led you to connect with me a lot quicker, like amidst all my calls. The second is the team collaboration. You know, we all are in a remote world now and be able to actually be in a space right now with my team where they can listen to this is very powerful. And then the 3rd key pillar Is we actually structure your objection data. We analyze your objections and your recordings with AI and we can structure data for you So you can make more informed decisions about coaching. And you can even see like conversion rates for different types of objections. So that those
13. [Prospect]  So do you have data like like Gong has data?
14. [Sales Rep]  Similar. Yeah. Although we actually have some folks in our team that come from Gong. They'll be the 1st to tell you that, Gong Doesn't really it's not really built for cold calling analytics. So think of us as the ones that actually do that.
15. [Prospect]  What was the 2nd point that you said? You said you differ on 3 fronts. What was the 2nd point? I had a question about that.
16. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. The virtual Salesforce, as we call it. Essentially, it's a virtual co working space. A bit more natural feeling than Zoom or Google Meet. And it's purpose built for team CallBlitzes. So right now,
17. [Prospect]  Got it.
18. [Sales Rep]  my team is is listening in and and and and on how I talk. But I like handle this conversation with you.
19. [Prospect]  Cool. So are your calls recorded?
20. [Sales Rep]  They are. If you if you if your org approves of you recording calls, because sometimes there are regulatory requirements that people have to abide by.
21. [Prospect]  Right. That was going to be my question.
22. [Sales Rep]  Yeah, you can use NUCs can be configured be compliant with 2 party consent regulation, TCPA regulation, you know the works. GDPR, all that good stuff.
23. [Prospect]  Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool. Well, hey. I I certainly appreciate the the overview and how you may differ from some of the other stuff out there. Why don't you do this? Why don't you put me on your radar for beginning of December? Like I said, I'm I'm kind of in the midst of of jumping around right now. So I wanna make sure that whatever decisions I make obviously are a fit for the next org that I'm at, and I'll probably need some time to settle in to, you know, to wherever I land. So why don't you shoot me a message at the beginning of December and let's let's touch base then.
24. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. For sure. I just added you on LinkedIn. So I'll, I'll make a note to to reach out. If you really are trying to get back to the workforce before the the holidays, then I'll reach out to you. Wonderful. Take care, Jordan. Bye.
