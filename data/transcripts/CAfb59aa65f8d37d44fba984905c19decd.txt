1. [Prospect]  Hello.
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Benjamin. It's Patrick Hong from Nooks. How's your, how's your Wednesday going?
3. [Prospect]  What's going on?
4. [Sales Rep]  I'm calling from a company called Nook's. And, I'm I'm giving you a cold call because it looks like you it looks like you manage a team of SDRs over at Jotform.
5. [Prospect]  Yeah.
6. [Sales Rep]  Do you mind if I give you, like, the the reason why I'm calling in 20 Seconds. And if it sounds totally irrelevant, you can feel free to hang up on me because that's not a good deal.
7. [Prospect]  Patrick, I I know your job sucks, so go ahead.
8. [Sales Rep]  I don't hate it too much, but, it's, so, basically, here's what we're doing for teams. We're helping your team of of out reps increase the amount of calls they're making on a daily basis, making it more efficient for them, increasing the conversations, increasing the app ads they're having, And at the same time, giving them a virtual sales floor where they can really inject a lot of fun and energy into calling sessions. And then on the back end, we're actually collecting all those transcripts and helping your enablement team pinpoint where the team really needs help and can convert those at bats 2 actual meetings and pipeline generation. So the TLDR and headline of the story there is help your team make more calls and get more conversations Increased conversions on those conversations to meetings. So I want to take a step back. Is cold calling a pretty big piece of your pipeline generation strategy or or, you know, What does your
9. [Prospect]  It's actually not, but I want it to I want to do more cold calling. So this sounds interesting, Patrick, because I think You hit on 3 things: a) it's going to be outbound b) we can make it fun, right? And then c) Anything that we don't flip, we can get that data to our lead gen team, and they can help script some better messaging. Is that what I kinda got from you?
