1. [Prospect]  This is Tyler. Hello?
2. [Sales Rep]  Hey, Tyler. Skylar Bass over at Nook's. I'm not sure if I'm in the right spot here, but saw you're as SDR manager. Do your reps ever, like, struggle to get connecting conversations over the phone by any chance?
3. [Prospect]  I am not an SDR manager. That was years ago.
4. [Sales Rep]  Hey. No no worries. Sorry about that. Must be Zoom info acting up from time to time.
5. [Prospect]  I get that. I get that.
6. [Sales Rep]  I guess nothing to do with cold calling currently then?
7. [Prospect]  I'm in sales, so we do do cold calling.
8. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Gotcha. I guess looks like okay. Now you're a senior account executive. Okay. Cool. Do do you guys use anything for dialing over there, like or mainly just out of, like, Outreach or SalesLoft?
9. [Prospect]  Outreach right now, we are a team of 2, so
10. [Sales Rep]  Okay. Cool. Yeah. I guess it probably wouldn't be super helpful at this point, but, essentially, once the team, you know, you guys scale up and start making, like, a pretty decent amount of dials. So this may not even be applicable from an AU standpoint currently. But instead of, you know, spending all day making a 100 dials and listening to phone ring. With Nook's, you can typically have 10 to 20 convos per hour. So instead of, you know, listening to the phone ring, logging no answer over and over again, you just spend that time talking to prospects.
11. [Prospect]  Okay. Cool. How are you guys priced? Like so I actually applied in with late rounds at Orem, one of your sounds like they're a competitor of yours.
12. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
13. [Prospect]  Similar product, I'm assuming.
14. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Very similar. We have a few more features around, like, enablement and, like, personalization. So trying to pull in more custom fields and not their their pricing, I used to use them. It's been pretty it fluctuates a lot. Our list price used to be about half theirs, but now it's pretty even. Our pricing is between, like, 2 to 300 a user per month.
15. [Prospect]  Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. I think we're probably not the right people Right company right now. We're so small. Yeah. But, if we get growing, Then I may reach out. What is your name?
16. [Sales Rep]  Hey. No no worries. Yeah. It's Skyler with the s.
17. [Prospect]  Okay. Cool.
18. [Sales Rep]  Awesome.
19. [Prospect]  Yes. Send me your contact information. We'll hang on to it. Ifwhen we get to that point, do worth reaching out. So, we did use Orem
20. [Sales Rep]  Cool. Sounds good.
21. [Prospect]  at my last company, had a good experience to a degree, And so it's something that is interesting, just not right now.
22. [Sales Rep]  Hey. No worries. Totally get it. I'll send you a LinkedIn, connect, and then I can send you, like, a quick one pager if that's helpful. But best of luck with everything.
23. [Prospect]  Cool. Yeah. Thanks, man. See you, Skyler.
24. [Sales Rep]  Have a good one.
