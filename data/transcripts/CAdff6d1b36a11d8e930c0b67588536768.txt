3. [Prospect]  Sean with who?
4. [Sales Rep]  Nook's, Mitch, this is a cold call. I know it's Friday. I'm shooting my shot here. Do you have a quick 30 seconds for me?
5. [Prospect]  Hey, man. What's going on?
6. [Sales Rep]  Awesome, dude. Yeah. You know, reaching out because I noticed, obviously, you're the director of business development there at dispatch track. I work for
7. [Prospect]  I'll go ahead and save your time, man. I'm leaving dispatch Track. I'm moving over to another company here in about 2 weeks. I'm a be starting up their business development. So Right now, I'm not a good prospect for you, but why don't you tell me a little about what you do because I'm definitely looking to build out the tech stack there, and I'm always open to learn about new things that are out there.
8. [Sales Rep]  Right on, man. Right on. So, essentially, what we're doing is we're a live conversation platform that gets your reps into more conversations. Think of it as like a
9. [Prospect]  Okay. So, like
10. [Sales Rep]  yeah. Go ahead.
11. [Prospect]  Go ahead. So you're like a dialer?
12. [Sales Rep]  Exactly. It's a dialer and a virtual sales floor for, like, the collaboration piece of it.
13. [Prospect]  Or Does it have a conversational intelligence piece, kind of like a gong or a chorus as well as a dialer?
14. [Sales Rep]  The calls do get recorded. Absolutely. You do see the transcripts of the call as well as far as, like, you being a leader. You could chat. You could tell them, hey. Try saying this. You know, there is a really cool Cool. Virtual collaboration piece of it if you have a remote team. The new place that you're going, right, is that kinda what you might be building up?
15. [Prospect]  Yeah. I mean, I'm on our remote team. I mean, I'm gonna go full sales cycle after I get the thing kinda ramped up. I'm a hire some folks. But, You know, I've used some dialers in the past, and some were complete shit, and some were actually really awesome.
16. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
17. [Prospect]  Orem was a great, great tool. I don't know Hey. Kinda stack it compared to Orem. They're expensive, but they had some really cool features like, the the ability to, to do multiple calls at once Simultaneously,
18. [Sales Rep]  Yep.
19. [Prospect]  it connects you with whoever answers so you can kinda, you know, shred through your call log really, really quick and also do it within time windows to where you need to actually call people. So I found that beneficial anyway. There's some good good, analytics behind it too, around, like, Talk times and objections and things objections, things like that. Do you guys do that sort of stuff?
20. [Sales Rep]  Get ready for this. I actually used to work for Orem for about a year and a half. I was one of their top performers and,
21. [Prospect]  Okay
22. [Sales Rep]  yes, joined Nook's because of exactly what you're saying. Same features here, probably even faster iteration when it comes to Making things, adding things to the platform. Everything that I I actually am using the platform right now and I was using the dialer Connected with you. I see all your pertinent information in front of my screen.
23. [Prospect]  I won't give you a heads up. You came as Potential spam, but
24. [Sales Rep]  Oh, okay. I gotta change I gotta change my number.
25. [Prospect]  from an 818 just to give you a heads up, man. I don't have I'd look out for that, so I make my Never have an SDR team. I haven't checked that pretty frequently, but, yeah, man, you might wanna switch that up.
26. [Sales Rep]  Yeah, I made a few, a couple of 100 dials today, so I got to change that number. But the idea is the same thing here as far as, yeah, more conversations in less time. Look, it sounds like there might be of interest. Do you would you be opposed for just like a 15 minute quick show you the UI? No, like, Promises on using the platform just more or less just showing you how it works.
27. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. I mean, yeah, I'll I'll check it out.
28. [Sales Rep]  Yep.
29. [Prospect]  I will have a budget, and I will have the opportunity to build out that stack. I mean, it's gonna probably be about a month Time frame from now.
30. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
31. [Prospect]  But, I mean, yeah, I'm all I'm all open to that. Why don't you connect me on LinkedIn? I'll get you a meeting. You're compensated on those. Yeah. I'll check it out. I mean, like, this moment, no. I'm not a good prospect, but I will be in, you know, next month. And I'm gonna be doing my due diligence and, you know, Orem was something I was definitely gonna be looking into. So,
32. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
33. [Prospect]  I mean,
34. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
35. [Prospect]  they're expensive As hell, no, man. I mean, compared to most dialing, here's what. They're definitely they're top dollar, but, I mean, it works. It it does what it's supposed to do, at least. I mean, our connection rate went up Substantially once I brought that on. So
36. [Sales Rep]  Yep.
37. [Prospect]  it was,
38. [Sales Rep]  Right on. Is that what they're using right now at, dispatch track? Is that what you just said?
39. [Prospect]  definitely good. No. No. There's there's a different group, and they got rid of all the stuff that was working. They completely fucked everything up to be completely frank. They're thinking stiff, dude. I'm so glad to be out of there. But,
40. [Sales Rep]  Gotcha. I appreciate being honest.
41. [Prospect]  this new place, yeah.
42. [Sales Rep]  Cool, man. Well, is it is it too early for me to just throw something on your calendar, or you don't have the email ready, or what would you prefer?
43. [Prospect]  No. I don't have an email with them yet. I literally just I mean, they got me an For today, so I don't have an email active with it yet. I mean, you can send it to my Gmail if you want, and I can check it out. I mean,
44. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah.

50. [Sales Rep]  Alright. You you tell me what works.
51. [Prospect]  You need it do you need it to fit this month?

53. [Prospect]  Oh, okay. Got you, man.
54. [Sales Rep]  What do you prefer? I don't wanna be pushy here. I I wanna respect.
55. [Prospect]  Well, here, I think we'll do we'll do the AE, man. It'll it'll be more beneficial you to, to review that whenever I'm with my head of sales because I'm gonna be in Croatia,
56. [Sales Rep]  Okay.
57. [Prospect]  October 16th. And that's whenever we're gonna be building out all the operations, integrating the tech stack They currently have. And also looking into some you know, exploring other vendors and things like that once we get ramped up. So it'd be beneficial if we Then then I you know, we could do a call with the whole team.
58. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. 100%. So do you prefer, like, 17, 16th, or should we wait until maybe you're you're starting and then we'll try to get a time going?
59. [Prospect]  Yeah. Let's do 16th. I'm really I'm starting the 8th. We got a trade show and stuff, so We'll have a little bit of time under my belt, but it'd probably better to do, like, the week of, like, 23rd. Maybe, like, 24th
60. [Sales Rep]  Okay.
61. [Prospect]  would probably be a good time.
62. [Sales Rep]  Let me see here. The 24th. Perfect. I'm PST, so Let me know
63. [Prospect]  Yeah. I mean, they're they're they're 9 hours ahead.

73. [Prospect]  Just a second. Cool, man. Hey. What do you wanna do? So what's the kind of differentiator,
74. [Sales Rep]  Alright.
75. [Prospect]  I mean, between you and you and. What what do you like to hear about it?
76. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Honestly, like, bridge time is is a big one. The UI, it's a lot more simpler, and we have, like, LinkedIn embedded into Nook's, where it's like you don't have to worry about the Pop up opening, like, other tabs that's in front of your face. I think that's been
77. [Prospect]  Okay.
78. [Sales Rep]  that's been my biggest, like, holy crap, like yeah.
79. [Prospect]  Yeah. Yeah. That was that was definitely a complaint from the team that I did get about Orem as well. Also, kinda like that lag time in between the connecting of calls was kind of an issue with them too.
80. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. I mean, you know, it occasionally happens if it doesn't
81. [Prospect]  But That's gonna happen, though. Let me ask you this. Do you got the integration with Outreach that Orum had?
82. [Sales Rep]  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hell yeah. Of course. That's our best one.
83. [Prospect]  Okay. Alright. Cool. Good. Because they're They're gonna be running outreach over there. They got the ZoomInfo, and they have,
84. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. Nice.
85. [Prospect]  freaking what was the other one. We're gonna probably add Chorus AI, the conversational intelligence piece that ZoomInfo acquired. We're probably gonna get that activated within ZoomInfo as well. And then They use Salesforce. So, obviously I mean, why would you not have a Salesforce Salesforce integration? That's kinda like
86. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
87. [Prospect]  Bare minimum.
88. [Sales Rep]  Yep.
89. [Prospect]  But, yeah, the fact you have the outreach integration, great, that bridge time. Is that what you're talking about whenever kind of like that?
90. [Sales Rep]  Yep. Exactly.
91. [Prospect]  Time to connect. Okay. Cool. Yeah. Because that was definitely I mean, if the team bitched about one thing, that was definitely it. No. It just sounds like I'm freaking like a robocall or something.
92. [Sales Rep]  Yeah.
93. [Prospect]  So
94. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Yeah. And to your point, you kind of nailed it. Like, it does occasionally happen, but that's only when it's not like Clean. Hello. Or you can't really hear what's on the other side. And, you know, they they have this thing that's called Magic Connect. I don't wanna feature them. I feel like,
95. [Prospect]  Okay.
