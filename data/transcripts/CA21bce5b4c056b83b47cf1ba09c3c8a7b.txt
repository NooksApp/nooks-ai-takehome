1. [Prospect]  Hi. This is Ryan.
2. [Sales Rep]  Ryan, this is Josh with Nook's. How's your Friday
3. [Prospect]  I'm sorry, say that again, I was having fun to roll this.
4. [Sales Rep]  Oh, no. No problem at all. Ryan, I said it's it's Josh with Nooks. How's your Friday treating
5. [Prospect]  It's going okay. Not great, but what can I help you with?
6. [Sales Rep]  Not great. I'm sorry to hear that. I know you've been a VP over there. You probably have a a 100 things going on before you close out the weekend. I Ryan, I'll be really quick here. I, I was just reaching out because I'm just curious if you probably literally have 300 things on your plate. I'm curious if, generating more pipe with outbound cold calls if that's something that you're overseeing at all or if that's something your team's working on.
7. [Prospect]  You're one of about 200 vendors that come to me with that same value prop.
8. [Sales Rep]  With the outbound cold call.
9. [Prospect]  Yep. Everyone everyone that's called me wants to increase my pipeline, improve our win rates, your reps to be productive faster. So, you know, I hear it all day all day long every every week.
10. [Sales Rep]  Yeah. Preaching the choir. I'm I'm probably I'm probably drowning in a big list of other voices. I'm What I will say, Ryan, is if outbound cold calls is part of that, like, if you have an SDR team, BDR team making a lot of cold calls, what what Nook's does is I mean, I my last org, we trialed it, and I I quit and came work here instead because what we're doing here is we're helping Your team be able to 5 x those conversations that they're having, and then increase those pipeline because you're having more calls, more conversations, more meetings. Is that is that something that you've never thought about?
11. [Prospect]  We thought about it, but I just I don't manage that team. But I'm not at liberty to give out the name of the person who does. But I'm sure you can
12. [Sales Rep]  Totally. Totally fair. Yeah. I'm pretty good at LinkedIn searching as an SDR. I gotta admit that. K. Ryan, I appreciate your time. I will I'll go ahead and I'll do some research and reach out. Good to know though that you guys are are doing that, so I'm kind of pointing in the right direction here. Yeah. Brian, appreciate you. Hope you have a really good week. K.
